# shell tool that use RE
- some of the most common
  - grep: recursive file content search
  - fd : find file and -exec
  - tr, sed


# grep
- grep take out matching line from files
- **rg** is a faster grep alternative 
``` bash
grep "RE" path/to/file  # Search for a pattern within a file
grep -R "RE" path/to/directory  # search recursively in directory
grep -C 3 "RE" path/to/file # print context: matched line + 3 lines before and after the match
grep --only-matching "RE" path/to/file # print only matched text
```
