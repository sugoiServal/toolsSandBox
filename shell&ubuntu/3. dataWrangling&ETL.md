- ref to https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1q52yD2l4xzx3GvXIlCX8ir6PVOm54Y1l7syQysuu-eo/edit

- RegularExpression in unix often surround by /regExp/

# Data Wrangling
- ref https://missing.csail.mit.edu/2020/data-wrangling/
- **what is it**: turn data from one format to another format


## grep
- **filter** data and return lines of interest; take out matching line from files
- grep return $? = 0 if success match, else $? = 1
- grep use **Regular Expression**!!
- **rg** is a faster grep alternative 
``` bash
grep "RE" path/to/file  # Search for a pattern within a file
grep -R "RE" path/to/directory  # search recursively in directory
grep -C 3 "RE" path/to/file # print context: matched line + 3 lines before and after the match
grep --only-matching "RE" path/to/file # print only matched text
```

``` bash
# pipe example

ssh myserver 'journalctl | grep sshd | grep "Disconnected from"' | less
# login myserver and run command 'journalctl | grep sshd | grep "Disconnected from"'
  # journalctl: print connect log to ctl
  # filter through: sshd,  "Disconnected from"
# the data is downloaded and piped to less
```

## sed
- analyzer/editor for stdin (stream data)
  - content **substitution**
  - **adding**
  - **deleting** 
- sed use **Regular Expression**!!
``` bash
# substitution
sed 's/<TargetExp>/<replacement>/g' <filename>
  # 's' means substitution, 'g' means substitution all occurrence
  # three /// separate the matching Expression and the substitution text 

sed -e 's/<TargetExp>/<replacement>/' <filename>  # -e apply the change to the file

ssh myserver journalctl
 | grep sshd
 | grep "Disconnected from"
 | sed 's/.*Disconnected from //'     # remove contents before 'Disconnected from'



# delete
sed '/<TargetExp>/d'    # delete lines matching the pattern


# add
echo "I like programming." | sed 's/ing./& Do you like programming?/' # append 'Do you like programming?' directly after the matching 'ing.', & sign in replacement keeps the original string

echo "I am like programming." | sed 's/am/& Do you like programming?/g'  # insert to every matching point

sed '2 a b01\tBaking powder'   # add as line: add(a) 'b01\tBaking powder' after line 2 

```
``` bash
# EXAMPLE: get userName from testing strings
'Jan 17 08:49:00 thesquareplanet.com sshd[2744]: Disconnected from invalid user wp-user 89.134.42.194 port 38866 [preauth]'

'Jan 17 03:13:00 thesquareplanet.com sshd[2631]: Disconnected from invalid user Disconnected from 46.97.239.16 port 55920 [preauth]'

'Jan 17 10:00:29 thesquareplanet.com sshd[2775]: Disconnected from user jon 18.26.4.53 port 39872'

ssh myserver journalctl
 | grep sshd
 | grep "Disconnected from"
 | sed -E 's/.*Disconnected from (invalid |authenticating )?user (.*) [^ ]+ port [0-9]+( \[preauth\])?$/\2/'
 | less
 # the RegExp: /.*Disconnected from (invalid |authenticating )?user (.*) [^ ]+ port [0-9]+( \[preauth\])?$/ matches all log pattern in the stdin stream
      # [^ ] is a litte confusing, it match characher that is not ' ', one or more times, which matches the IP address field from the test string

 # there are two capture groups, one is (invalid |authenticating ) as \1, and the other is (.*) as \2, which is also the field of userName
 # the sed command replace everything with \2, so only userNames being printed out

```


## sort, unique, wc, head, tail
- sort: sort by line
``` bash
sort --ignore-case -r  # ignore case; reverse order
sort -n   # numeric-sort
sort --field-separator=: --key=3n /etc/passwd  # use : as field separator, sort the third field
sort -nk1,1   # numeric; whitespace-separated(k); first field till first field (1,1)
```
- unique: fold repeat line
``` bash
unique -c  #  count occurance as column
```
  
- head/tail: get the first/last n lines
``` bash
head -n10   # cut first n=10 line
tail -n10   # cut last n=10 line 
```
- wc: word count
```bash
wc       # count work
wc -l    # count number of line
```
``` bash
ssh myserver journalctl
 | grep sshd
 | grep "Disconnected from"
 | sed -E 's/.*Disconnected from (invalid |authenticating )?user (.*) [^ ]+ port [0-9]+( \[preauth\])?$/\2/'
 | uniq -c          # keep unique line and create counter field (first column)
 | sort -nk1,1      # sort by first column
 | tail -n20        # display the 20 most common userName
``` 
## paste, cut
- paste: (delimiter) merge lines into 1 line; merge files into table
``` bash
paste -s -d <delimiter> <file>    # merge lines(-s) into 1 line, using specified delimiter (-d)
paste -d <delimiter> <file1> <file2> # Merge two files side by side, each in its column, using the specified delimiter
```

- cut: cut out field of each line through delimiter
``` bash
cut -c 1-16 <file>   # Cut out the first sixteen characters of each line
cut -d';' -f2,10     # cut out fields 2 and 10, use ';' as delimiter
cut -d' ' -f3-10     # cut out fields 2 to 10, use ' ' as delimiter
``` 
## awk 
A versatile programming language for working on files
- More information: https://github.com/onetrueawk/awk.
``` bash
awk -F ',' '{print $5}' filename # Print the fifth column $5 in a' ',' -separated' file
 
awk '/exp/ {print $2}' filename  # Print the second column of the lines matching /exp/ in a space-separated file (default delim ' ')

awk '{s+=$NF} END {print s}' filename  # Sum the values in the last column ($NF) of a file and print the total

awk '($10 >= min_value && $10 <= max_value) && $2 ~ /exp/'  # Print all the lines which the 10th column value is between min and max and 2nd column match /exp/
```


# R
- R statistics tool command line interface... 
``` bash
ssh myserver journalctl
 | grep sshd
 | grep "Disconnected from"
 | sed -E 's/.*Disconnected from (invalid |authenticating )?user (.*) [^ ]+ port [0-9]+( \[preauth\])?$/\2/'
 | sort | uniq -c
 | awk '{print $1}' | R --no-echo -e 'x <- scan(file="stdin", quiet=TRUE); summary(x)'
