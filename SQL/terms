 # Database	terms 
 
### **Database**: a database is a collection of data stored in some organized fashion. A data dump.		

### **DBMS**: Database Management System -- set of Applications that can be used to manage a large chunk of data dump: data dump + API, useful tools to access, modify data							

  				
                    
### **RDBMS**: Relational Database Management System				
    - subset of DBMS					
    - products: MySQL, MS SQL Server, IBM DB2, Oracle, ,Microsoft Access				
    - store as table. table of related data entries consists of columns and rows(record).
### **Relational DB, Relational Table: in Relational DB, information is split into multiple tables, tables in the DB are interrelated**
    -  a **primary key** of a table may be a field of another table
    -  a table only store fields that belong only to the primary key, eliminating the need to update other tables if a field needs to be updated
### **Table**: A structured list of data of a specific type

    - is a standard (American National Standards Institute (ANSI) in 1986, and of the - International Organization for Standardization (ISO) in 1987)								
    - All RDBMS products are compliant to SQL, ie support all basic SQL functionalitis, but may provides more tools and grammar. (ie, more to learn)										

       
### **Referential integrity**: means that the DBMS enforces data integrity rules: data integrity must be cross-reference from all tables that containing related fields	

### **ScaleAble/ Scale Well**: DB design able to handle increasing scale without failing
