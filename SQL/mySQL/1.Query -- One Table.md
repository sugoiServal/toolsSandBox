# Retrieve Data
## SELECT FROM
- modifiers: 
    - DISTINCT: only distince values
    - LIMIT 6 OFFSET 5;   : select 6 rows from the 6th row(skip 5 row)
      - or LIMIT 5, 6; 6 is the number of row, 5 is the offset;

- eg
``` SQL
    SELECT prod_id, prod_name, prod_price	
    FROM Products;	

    SELECT *	
    FROM Products;	
    LIMIT 6 OFFSET 5; 
    -- select 6 rows from the 6th row(skip 5 row)
    -- same as LIMIT 5, 6;

    SELECT DISTINCT vend_id
    FROM Products;
```

# View Data
## 1). Sort: ORDER BY
- modifiers:
    - DESC
    - ASC(default)
  

- EG: 
``` SQL
    -- order by two columns, first by prod_price, then prod_name 

    SELECT prod_id, prod_price, prod_name
    FROM Products
    ORDER BY prod_price DESC, prod_name ;   
        -- third line short as: ORDER BY 2, 3
            -- 2 means 2nd select(prod_price)
            -- 3 means 3nd select(prod_name)
        -- prod_price in DESC order, prod_name in default order
```
## 2). Custom field(column) and Alias
- return new column (not exist in DB) through calculation or formatting, and give the column a name through Alias
- Alias: SELECT ... AS \<yourFieldName>

- eg
``` SQL
SELECT prod_id, quantity,item_price, 
    quantity*item_price AS expanded_price
FROM OrderItems WHERE order_num =20008;

SELECT Concat(RTrim(vend_name),' (',RTrim(vend_country),')')
    AS vend_title
FROM Vendors ORDER BY vend_name;
```
### 2.0) CASE (WHEN THEN ELSE) END
- basically if-else statement

``` SQL
SELECT title, stock_quantity,
    CASE 
        WHEN stock_quantity BETWEEN 0 AND 50 THEN '*'   
        -- if1: stock_quantity BETWEEN 0 AND 50 ...
        WHEN stock_quantity BETWEEN 51 AND 100 THEN '**'
        -- if2: stock_quantity BETWEEN 51 AND 100 ...
        ELSE '***'
        -- else ...
    END AS STOCK
FROM books; 
```

```

### 2.5) aggregate functions (return single value)
- **Column rows containing NULL values are generally ignored, by may be counted in some scenerios, need to see doc**
<center> 

| sign    | meaning       |
|---------|---------------|
| DISTINCT | only take in distince values, eg: SELECT AVG(DISTINCT prod_price)|
| AVG(), SUM() | 易知|
|COUNT() | 计数 |
| MAX, MIN(）| 最小最大|

</center>

- COUNT(NULL) = 0, other aggregate functions taking NULL as input return NULL

### 2.4) misc
<center> 

| sign    | meaning       |
|---------|---------------|
| CONVERT() | cast datatype |
</center>

``` SQL
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT author_fname) FROM books;
```

## 3). Grouping Data: GROUP BY + HAVING
- grouping is used in conjunction with aggregate functions: to divide data-points into subsets through logical condition, and perform aggregate calculate to each group

### GROUP BY
- **must provide a column or a column expression to GROUP BY**, alias is not allowed
- Aside from the aggregate calculation statements, **every column in the SELECT statement must be present in the GROUP BY clause.**
- NULL valued data-points will be grouped as individual group
- **GROUP BY must come after WHERE clause**
- It's a good practice is to always use SORT BY after GROUP BY to sort the final data view
- eg
``` SQL
SELECT vend_id, COUNT(*) AS num_prods
FROM Products
GROUP BY vend_id;
-- GROUP BY clause instructs the DBMS to group the vend_id by distinct value (and sort it), 
-- and then perform the aggregate COUNT(*) on each group
```
- GROUP BY with multiple column also works:
  - Group By X means **put all those with the same value for X in the one group.**
  - Group By X, Y means **put all those with the same values for both X and Y in the one group.**
  - ....
  
```SQL
SELECT concat(author_fname, ' ',  author_lname) AS author, 
       concat(title, ' - ', Min(released_year)) AS firstWork
FROM   books 
GROUP BY author_lname, author_fname
ORDER BY Min(released_year);
```
## HAVING
- used to filter groups, similar to WHERE clause, but be only be used with GROUP BY 
  - WHERE filters before data is grouped, and  HAVING filters after data is grouped
  - Since **GROUP BY must come after WHERE clause**, data-points will being filtered by WHERE at first, and will not be grouped
- eg
```SQL
SELECT cust_id, COUNT(*) AS numOrders
FROM Orders 
GROUP BY cust_id
HAVING COUNT(*)>=2;
-- find cust_id whose number of Orders exceed 2
-- Order of execution: 
    --GROUP BY cust_id => 
    --filter through HAVING COUNT COUNT(*)>=2 (reduce Number of Group) => 
    --calculate for each group with COUNT(*) AS numOrders
```

# Limit Data

## 1). Filtering: 
- Filtering: take only entres that match some conditions

### 1.1) **WHERE**
- strict matching, logical matching
- tips:
  - filter + sort, sort should come after filter: WHERE first and then SORT BY
  
- logic table
  - 小心 BETWEEN AND 和 AND, 同一个AND有不同的语义

   
<center>

| sign    | meaning       |
|---------|---------------|
| =       | 等于          |
| !=      | 不等于        |
| <=      | 小于等于      |
| !<      | 不小于        |
| BETWEEN AND | 在2个数字之间 |
| IS NULL | 是NULL        |
| AND, &&     | condition交 (限制)   |
| OR, \|\|   | condition并(放宽)    |
| IN (...)  | 在某一指定集合(...)中    |
| NOT |  取非    |
| (...)    | 防止歧义     |
|IFNULL(exp1, exp2)|如果exp1的数据非NULL，返回exp1数据，如果是NULL, 返回exp2|
|IF(logi, exp1, exp2)|如果logi为true, 返回exp1， 否则返回exp2|
</center>
   


- eg:
``` SQL
SELECT prod_name, prod_price
FROM Products
WHERE prod_price NOT BETWEEN 5 AND 10;
```




### 1.2) **LIKE**: wildcard 
- mySQL supports both classic wildcard as well as regular expression 
- **ref https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/pattern-matching.html**
- SQL wildcard table
- 
<center>

| sign    | meaning       |
|---------|---------------|
| _     | match any single character       |
| %     | match an arbitrary number of characters (including zero characters)       |
| []     | match a set of characters to one position       |
| ^    | negate a wildcard      |
| NOT LIKE     | negate like (outside of the match set)      |
| \ | escape sign|
</center>

- eg
``` SQL
SELECT prod_id, prod_name
FROM Products
WHERE prod_name LIKE'Fish%';

SELECT * FROM pet WHERE REGEXP_LIKE(name, '^.{5}$')
```
# SUMMARY
