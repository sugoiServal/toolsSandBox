# Recursion
## comments
- most data structure's traverse is through Recursion
- Recursion can easily be inefficient. It's essentially reuse of function, and by the reuse it's easily to fall into the pitfall of recalculation. fibonacci is the stark example of the issue
# Divide and Conquer
## Design
to solve a problem of size N
- **Divide** the problem into subproblems each of size < n
- **Conquer**: solve each subproblems recursively and independent of the other subproblems
- **Merge** all solutions into a solution of the Original problem
