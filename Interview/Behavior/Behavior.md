### self-reflect: stengths and weaknesses

- maintain a habit of daily self-reflection
- approach: self-reflect. feedback from other people (time consuming, leave it for the future)
- guideline: provide solution to improve the weakness

```go
// stengths
methodical and organized: break down the large problem of goal, and solve the problem with priorities or the level of optimization
a long span of attention and very persistent to the goal. for a current task
from time to time, I could take a pause and think big, to determine if I can optimize the flow and the tasks set, to allow me to reach the goal better and fast.

Problem solving skills: creativity, analysis skill, 

solid foundation and wide range of experiences in the technical world, and have a passion to it.
established daily routines that maximize my productivity, over the year
reflect my weakness frequently and not afraid of changing

// weaknesses
slightly lack of communication efficiency. On one hand it is because that I am a immigrant, and it also because that I spent most the time, over a year, diving into my technical skills development. In recent monthes, I have been trying to improve it by exchanging ideas and thought to my parents and friends, and working in part time.

A bit stress prone. I used to have a tendency to set too unrealistic or strict time-contrainted goals and work restlessly. I trying to combact stress by improve my workflow and relax more efficiently. And I have gain understanding to my current limit and be more realistic about my personal goal.
