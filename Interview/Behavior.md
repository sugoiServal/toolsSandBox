- STAR= Situation, Task, Action, Result

  - Situation: Context of the story
  - Task: Challenge (goals, contraints...)
  - Action: your decision, step you take
  - Result: Highlight the outcome and learning

### TODO: self introduction

### self-reflect: stengths and weaknesses

- approach: self-reflect. feedback from other people (time consuming, leave it for the future)
- guideline: provide solution to improve the weakness

```go
// stengths
methodical: break down the large problem of goal, and solve the problem with priorities or the level of optimization
a long span of attention and very persistent to the goal. for a current task
from time to time, I could take a pause and think big, to determine if I can optimize the flow and the tasks set, to allow me to reach the goal better and fast.

If you know MBTI, I am mostly an INTJ at work, my goal is to become an ENTJ

solid foundation and wide range of experiences in the technical world, and have a passion to it.
established daily routines that maximize my productivity, over the year
reflect my weakness frequently and not afraid of changing

// weaknesses
slightly lack of communication efficiency. On one hand it is because that I am a immigrant, and it also because that I spent most the time, over a year, diving into my technical skills development. In recent monthes, I have been trying to improve it by exchanging ideas and thought to my parents and friends, and working in part time.

A bit stress prone. I used to have a tendency to set too unrealistic or strict time-contrainted goals and work restlessly. I trying to combact stress by improve my workflow and relax more efficiently. And I have gain understanding to my current limit and be more realistic about my personal goal.

### My past experience

- approach:
  - STAR= Situation, Task, Action, Result
  - prepare few stories

### Future

- What title (fields) you want to become (work on) in the future

  - what you see yourself in 5 years

### Give me an example where you had a disagreement with your product manager or with your supervisor and how did you deal with that situation

- approach: STAR
  - situation, task: supervisor want something
  - action: shows that you listen to both sides (discussions) and provide a better solution
  - Result: be accepted and generate better results
