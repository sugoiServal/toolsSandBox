# confusing concepts
## same memory?
```python
a = [1, 2, 3]
b = a               
# eval if two variable(object) is the same memeory
a is b                  # way 1
id(a) == id(b)          # way 2
```
## assignment, memory, reference
- assignment (=), most of time, is alias, aka reference
- distinguish three concept:
    - in-place: operation conduct in same memeory
    - deep-copy: content copied to new memory, (processed), then assign(ref) to new variable 
    - assign/reference: existing memory, either have any reference or not, being bind to an variable
```python
a = [3, 2, 1, 0]; origin_memory = id(a);           #a created

b = a; print(id(b) == id(a))                       #True. b binded/ref/assign to the same memory

a.sort(); print(id(b) == id(a))                    #True. a, b -> data being sorted "in-place"

a = a[:3]; print(id(b) == id(a))                   #False. a, b -> data being deep-copy and processed in newMemory; a ref to newMemory, b -> origin_memory

b = sorted(a); print(id(b) == origin_memory)       #False. sorted(a) deep copy newMemory and process in newMemory2; b ref to newMemory2; data in origin_memory lost forever

```
## immutable object 
- mutable objects can be changed in place
  - mutable objects includes:
    - Lists
    - Sets
    - Dictionaries
    - User-Defined/third-party-pkg Classes 
- immutable objects cannot be modified once created
  - immutable objects includes:
    - Numbers (Integer, Rational, Float, Decimal, Complex & Booleans)
    - Strings
    - Tuples
    - Frozen Sets
    - User-Defined/third-party-pkg Classes 
- ***why is number/Strings immutable? I can assign new number to same variable!!***
```python
# First we need to distinguish variable and object
    # variable is in essense a reference or alias to an object
    # object is the memory area that actually hold the data, mutable or immutable

# A variable can set to different number, but the memory area (object) it actually refers to is no longer the same
x = 77
o_id = id(x)
x = 78
print(o_id == id(x))     # False !

# that explans why these objects are immutable, once the value (of immutable objects) of a variable change, the variable MUST refer to another object
```

- function argument problem of mutable/immutable objects:
  - ***how do I know if a variable passed as argument, modified within a function, will change the variable outside?***
  - **Ans:** 
    - If the value passed in a function is **immutable**, the function **does not modify** the caller’s variable. 
    - If the value is **mutable**, the function **modify** the caller’s variable in-place
    - in general, re-reference within a function **do not modify** the caller’s variable

```python
def TryToModify(x, y, z):
    x = 23          # re-reference
    y.append(42)    # in-place change mutable variable (why? we call the object's method!)
    z = [99]        # re-reference


x = 77          # immutable variable
y = [99]        # mutable variable
z = [28]        # mutable variable
TryToModify(x, y, z)

print(x)        # 77, unchanged
print(y)        # [99, 42], changed mutable object
print(z)        # [28], unchanged mutable object

```

## reference, shallow copy, deep copy
- reference, as described, via assignment, is alias
- shallow copy, eg: an original_array of objects(references to them), via shallow copy, objects won't be cloned, but only the references will be copied, and therefore both arrays will have references to the same objects (two array of same references).
- deep copy: A deep copy of an object is a copy whose properties do not share the same references. The resources to which references in original_array are also copied. Thus deep copy ensures that any change made to the new array will not reflect to the original_array

### list
```python
colors = ['red', 'blue', 'green', 'black', 'white']

# indexing
    colors[0] == 'red'                       # True
    colors[-1] == 'white'                    # True
# slicing: [start:stop:stride] OR [start:stop]. range from [start, stop), stop not inclusive
    colors[1:4:2]                            # ['blue', 'black']
    colors[::-1]                             # reverse
# methods
    colors.append('pink')
    colors.pop()
    colors.extend(['pink', 'purple'])       # in-place extend the list
    colors.sort()                           # in-place sort

# copy
    colorsRev = colors[::-1]                    # deep copy to new object
    colors = colors[::-1]                       # deep copy to same object == in-place
    colors2 = list(colors)                      # deep copy to new object
    colorsS = sorted(colors)                    # new sorted object

# concat, repeat
    colors =  colors + colors
    colors = colors * 2
```
- list comprehension
```python
[i**2 for i in range(4)]
```
### string
```python
# string formatting:
    a_string = 'An integer: %i; a float: %f; another string: %s' % (1, 0.1, 'string') 
# split string to list based on delim:
    a_list = a_string.split(' ')
```
### dictionary
- keys, values can have arbitrary types
```python
tel = { 'emmanuelle': 5752, 
        'sebastian': 5578 }
# insert
    tel['francis'] = 5915                 
# list keys/values
    tel.keys()              # iterable dict_keys
    tel.values()            # iterable dict_values
    tel.items()             # iterable dict_items of tuple ('key', value)
```
### Tuples
- immutable list
```python
t = (12345, 54321, 'hello!')
```
### Sets
- unordered, unique
```python
s = set(('a', 'b', 'c', 'a'))
# set operators
    s.intersection()
    s.add()
    s.difference()
```

# Control Structure
- what is special:
  - no "{}", use ":" at the beginning of structure
  - indentation!!!
  - no need "()" around expression, except for avoid Ambiguity

## branching

```python
# if-elif-else
    if a == 1:
        print(1)
    elif a == 2:
        print(2)
    else:
        print('A lot')
```

## iteration
```python
for i in range(4):
    print(i)

for word in ['cool', 'powerful', 'readable']:
    print('Python is %s' % word)

z = 2
while abs(z) < 100:
    z = z**2 + 1

# and break, continue...
```

- enumerate
  - The enumerate() method adds a **counter** to an iterable and returns it
    - input: enumerate(iterable, start=0)
    - return: a tuple (count, valueFromIterable) 
``` python
words = ['cool', 'powerful', 'readable']
for index, item in enumerate(words):
    print((index, item))
```

### iterator
- iterator
  - An iterator is an **object** that contains a countable number of values.
  - iterator implements the iterator protocol: consists of methods \_\_iter\_\_() and \_\_next\_\_().
- iterable objects
  - iterable objects is a container, all these container have a **iter()** method which return an iterator
  - almost all containers are iterable objects: Lists, tuples, dictionaries, sets / arrays, etc 
```python
iterable = "banana"            # iterable
myit = iter(iterable)          # iterator
print(next(myit))              # __next__()
```
- implement iterator
  - is essential to implement the two methods: \_\_iter\_\_() and \_\_next\_\_().
  - TODO
## Function
- function could take default value, syntaxly put them at the end
- function could return multiple objects
- **function pass everything by reference**
```python
def slicer(seq, start=None, stop=None, step=None):
     """Implement basic python slicing."""
     return seq[start:stop:step], (start, stop, step)

sliced_rhyme, _ = slicer('one fish, two fish, red fish, blue fish'.split(', '), 2, 5, 1) 
```
### variable number of argument
- Special forms of parameters:
    - *args: any number of positional arguments packed into a tuple
    - **kwargs: any number of keyword arguments packed into a dictionary
``` python
def variable_args(*args, **kwargs):
     print('args is', args)
     print('kwargs is', kwargs)
variable_args('one', 'two', x=1, y=2, z=3)
# "args is ('one', 'two')"
# "kwargs is {'x': 1, 'y': 2, 'z': 3}"
```

### Lambda Function
- A lambda function is a small， anonymous function.
- Lambda function is : any number of arguments and 1 expression

```python
# syntax
    # lambda arguments : expression

    x = lambda a, b, c : a + b + c
    print(x(5, 6, 2))
```
- lambda function is an object, means it can be
  - passed as argument to function
  - return by a function
```python
# an anonymous function generator 
    def mulplerGenerator(n):
        return lambda a : a * n   

    mydoubler = myfunc(2)   # doubler function
    mytripler = myfunc(3)   # tripler function
```

### **CAUTIOUS**: outside variable **CAN** be referenced within the function 
- ordinary function cannot changed the referenced outside variable
- except for using the **global** modifier
```python
x = 10

def setxFail(y):    
    x = y           # x is read-only, this line is useless

def setxForce(y):
    global x        # x is now writable in the function scope
    x = y           # x being re-referenced
    
setxFail(5)         
print(x)            # x =  10

setxForce(5)
print(x)            # x =  5
```

### **EXCITING**: Functions are Objects
means they can be:
- assigned to a variable
- be an item in a container
- passed as an argument to another function (aka callback function)

## error handling 
- The **try** block lets you test a block of code for errors.
- The **except** block lets you handle the error.
- The **else** block lets you execute code if no error is raised

- The **finally** block lets you execute code, regardless of the result of the try- and except blocks.

``` python
try:
  print(x)
except NameError:                   # specify error type
  print("Variable x is not defined")
except:                             # any type
  print("Something else went wrong")
else:
  print("Nothing went wrong")
```

### finally, with statement
- in a try clause, a finally block will be executed regardless if the try block raises an error or not 
- it is used to close objects/ clean up resrouces (eg: files or network connections)
```python
try:
    raise KeyboardInterrupt
finally:
    print('Goodbye, world!')
```
- **with** statement is encapsulation of common try…except…finally usage 
```python
# syntax:
    with A() as a, B() as b:
        #SUITE    
    # OR
    with (
        A() as a,
        B() as b,
    ):
        #SUITE
# with ensure object a and b are always cleaned up when they are no longer needed, regardless of the outcome of SUITE
```

### raise 
- exception, error can be raised manually
```python
x = -1
if x < 0:
  raise Exception("Sorry, no numbers below zero")
```
