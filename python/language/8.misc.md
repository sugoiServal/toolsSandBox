# setattr

- The setattr() function sets the value of the attribute of an object.
- The syntax of the setattr() function is:

```py
setattr(object, name, value)
```

```py
## this allow use < and > to compare .val attribute inside ListNode
# ie (if ListNodeA.val < ListNodeB.val, ListNodeA < ListNodeB)
# this is achieved by setting __lt__ attribute in the object
setattr(ListNode, "__lt__", lambda self, other: self.val <= other.val)
```

- Purpose: isolate your project's Python environment
  > "A virtual environment is a Python environment such that the Python interpreter, libraries and scripts installed into it are isolated from those installed in other virtual environments..."

```bash
pip install virtualenv

# setup venv
cd ${SRC_DIR}
python3 -m venv ${SRC_DIR}/.venv  # setup virtual environment in a folder .venv


# activate virtual environment
. ${SRC_DIR}/.venv/bin/activate

pip list  # check current installed dependencies

pip install -Ur ${SRC_DIR}/requirements.txt # install packages, (The virtual environment will make use of its own pip)
    # -r <file>: This option is followed by the path to a requirements file (usually requirements.txt)
    # -U or --upgrade: This option tells pip to upgrade the specified packages to the latest available versions.

# deactivate
deactivate
```
