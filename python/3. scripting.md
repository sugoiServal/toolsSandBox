## module and package
- module: any script can be imported as "module"
  - functions and variables defined with the script can be used by
```python
import module
module.SomeFunction()
print(module.kAConstant)
```
- package: 
  - in system, package is directory that contains many python scripts of similar functionality
  - in python, package is also a module, but with submodules (scripts)
  - A special file called **\_\_init\_\_.py** (which may be empty) tells Python that the directory is a Python package
  - you may want to include a package path in your python search path
## re-import
> "import" means: "load (aka cache) if not loaded  yet and then import into namespace" 
- Imported modules are cached (in python runtime), if imported 'module' is modified the dependent scripts with not recognize the change
``` python
# solution:
# in dependent scripts
    import module
# the module changed and need to reload.......   

    from importlib import reload 
    module = reload(module)
```
## relative and absolute path import TODO_0
> [ref](https://realpython.com/absolute-vs-relative-python-imports/)


# Add module to system path
- there are two ways
1) in system level
```bash
# write your module/script to python search path
/usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/

# or add symbolic links of your module/script in the directory
```
``` bash
# add your module path to environment variable PYTHONPATH 
export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/home/dir/to/your/module
```
2) within the script
- this way is not robust!!
- it only limit to the script scope. So always need to run the command when a modules need to be import
```python
import sys
new_path = '/home/emma/user_defined_modules'
if new_path not in sys.path:
    sys.path.append(new_path)
```


# if \_\_name\_\_ == '\_\_main\_\_':
- "if \_\_name\_\_ == '\_\_main\_\_':" separate the code into two parts
  - those before it will be run **BOTH** on being import and on direct-run (as a main, standalone process)
  - those after it will **NOT** be run on import, but **ONLY** on direct-run (as a main, standalone process)
- Usually it's written before the main script, to protect it from being run when it is imported

```python
# this part runs on import
print("will run on import")
if __name__ == '__main__':
    # this part is only executed when the module is run directly.
    print("ONLY run on execution")
```
