- you can call me Evan
- i am a computer science master graduated from University of ottawa last year
- I've been coding in C++ and python back in my undergrad, and has been doing web developments for over a year focusing on nodejs with react framework work. I've done dozens of small projects in either frontend or full-stack and each time I find some new technology is I have not yet used before and And trying to learn it and apply it to these projects. I must say I'm still actively learning in this field especially interested in the cloud computing this year.
- besides web, I also have some experience in machine learning I have quite some experience in preparing data and pipe them into some kind of statistical or machine learning algorithms, drawing graph or chart for comparison stuff like that. I did internship in the National Research Council, That one is about deep learning application and is a mainly researching project.

    - Then I start write some demo little projects with the new tool to see how it is used as a programmer, maybe trying to see if I can integrate the tool to one of the other projects I have done
    - Finally there must be a lot of details or additional features, and their integration to other tools, these will required too many times learn. I was generally just left them and move on to the next tool. until when I have the demands to actually use these features will I go back to them
