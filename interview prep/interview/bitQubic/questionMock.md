## Why should you use microservices architecture?
Microservices architecture can be beneficial in several ways, including:

Scalability: Microservices can be scaled independently, allowing for more efficient use of resources.

Flexibility: Each service can be developed and deployed using the best tools and technologies for the job, rather than being constrained by a monolithic architecture.

Resilience: Because each service is independently deployable and operates on its own data store, a failure in one service will not necessarily bring down the entire system.

Easier to maintain: Because each service is a smaller, self-contained unit, it is easier to understand, test, and maintain.

Flexible deployment: Microservices can be deployed in a variety of different environments, including on-premises, in the cloud, or in a hybrid configuration.

Improved Continuous Deployment: Because of the smaller and independent nature of each service, it can be deployed and updated more frequently, allowing for faster delivery of features and bug fixes.
