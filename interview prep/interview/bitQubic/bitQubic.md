# interview: ROLE-backend(product)
## my strength

## review
- Redis
- Docker, Kubernetes
- API development
- algorithm
- CICD, agile


### `redis`
- Redis Core: key-value type of data
- I know what it has to offer but many of the features are paid and I have no idea which one it the one I will be used
  - on ssd
  - more data types
  - data recovery and security, logging
- CURD operation 
- basic data types, var/ list/ set/ hash set
- nodejs client, npm package

### Docker, Kubernetes
- Docker: know what it is capable to do, and how to do (
  - dockerfile, 
  - Volumns (avoid rebuild in dev time), 
    - specify folders in host computer that can be made available to running containers.
  - docker-compose
    - Docker compose is able to store multiple image/container configuration
  - build, run, push/pull images)
  - what it is: packaging app with runtime (OS/file system, middleware/package/dependencies, config, code)
    - good for sharing, light weight
    - easy version control, deployment
    - run container as a process
- Kubernetes, much theoretical, less hand on, did a toy setup(minikube & kubectl)
  - communicating several docker instances  
  - theories:
    - scalability, stable, manage large amount docker nodes
    - components: 
      - control nodes
      - worker nodes
      - virtual network
    - finer grain:
      - pod: usually 1 application per pod, 1 Ip address
      - service: pod and backups that share perment incoming ip 
      - ingress: expose service, load balancer
      - configMap/secret: save sensitive/unsensitive configs
      - volumn: backup of data service pod
      - (DB)stateful set: replica for stateful apps: for example DBs
      - Depolyment: a config of all the above
### API development
primarily express + nodejs, REST or graphQL (hand on experiences both)
随便看看node

### algorithm: TODO

### cicd, jira
## dunno
- dunno:
  - [`blockchains API`](https://dogechain.info/api/blockchain_api)
  - `SQL optimization`
  - `(JAVA)Spring Boot`
  - `JSON-RPC`
  - `design patterns`
  - cloud
### database optimization
- general concepts, theoretically
  - sharding, resharding:
  - replica
  - logging/ recovery
- I know that some paid DB service offers these features  
- no hand on experience
### Cloud solutions
- 我还没很多的Cloud工具经验，但是有计划在今年学习AWS

## Mey questions
- `global team`: other location? how the heriarchy, size? what are this team's primary responsabiliy

- `research` spec vs code production (percent)

- use what to solve what kind of problems
  - Emphasize on optimization and scaling up?
- oceanEx: 
  - guess: have mature product(oceanEx) and working on scaling up/ adding feature
  - 和oceanEx关系: 是这边在运营还是他们是客户
