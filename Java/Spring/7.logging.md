- tools
- `SLF4J` acts as an abstraction layer (means it provides an API for logging but relies on logging frameworks to implement)
  - an abstraction layer mean smooth transition between framework
- `Logback` is an logging framework (implementation)
- `Log4j2` is an logging framework (implementation)

- 默认情况下，Spring Boot 包含 SLF4J 和 Logback。

- Logging Levels (logs are categorized by importance (level))
  - ERROR: Denotes that something failed, (might not be able to continue running).
  - WARN: Indicates a potential problem
  - INFO: Provides general information Typically used to confirm things are working
  - DEBUG: Offers issues diagnose information for debugging
  - TRACE: Gives more granular details than DEBUG, often including iterative or repetitive processes.
- Levels visability: visability are corresponding to the logging level
  - eg. if you set the level to WARN, you’ll also see ERROR messages, but not INFO, DEBUG, or TRACE.

### Configuring Logging in `application.properties`

```yaml
# global visibility level
logging.level.root=WARN
# package specific visibility level
logging.level.org.springframework.web=DEBUG
logging.level.com.myapp.service=INFO

# Log FIle Output
logging.file.name=myapp.log         # logs are printed to the console by default, but can also save to file

# rotate file when criteria is meeted: 防止任何单个文件变得太大
logging.file.max-size=10MB
logging.file.max-history=10

# customize log format
logging.pattern.console=%d{yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss} - %logger{36} - %msg%n
logging.pattern.file=%d{yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss} - %logger{36} - %msg%n
```

### Log in Spring Boot (with Lombok)

- @Slf4j: most commonly used

  - applied to a class, creates a static `SLF4J logger` instance named `log`

```java
@Slf4j
public class MyService {
    public void someServiceMethod() {
        log.info("Service method called using @Slf4j");
    }
}
```
