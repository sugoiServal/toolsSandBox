# why shell scripting
- draw the line: shell scriting is slow and resource consuming. it's not designed for computational heavy purpose
- where to use: 
  - simely data, string processing. 
  - system level operation,  
  - automation process, 
  - program pipeline,
  - CS experiments, iterations

# basic
``` bash
#           '#' for comment
sh/ bash     # execute script
#!/bin/bash  # declare the script is for bash
exit 0       # like C, always return 0 at the end
```
## shebang line
- any head of a script that start with !# is called shebang line
- it tells the kernel which scripting environment to look for and run with
- it is good practice to always add shebang line to any scripting language
``` bash
## can use /usr/bin/env YOURENV, 
    # env will make use of the PATH environment variable
    # This way, you don't have to look for it in a specific place on the system 
    
#!/bin/env bash
#!/bin/env python



## can also specify the location of env
#!/bin/bash
    # this will run with bash

#!/usr/local/bin/python
    # this will run with python
```


## variable
- variable is marked as $


### scripts' default variable (can use in script):
```bash
$0, $1, $2...   
    # $0 is the path to script
    # $1, $2... is argument passed into the script, if exist
$#      # number of arguments being passed in
$@      # independent string of arguments: "arg1" "arg2" ...
$*      # one string of arguments delimit by ' ': "arg1 arg2 ..."
$$      # Process identification number (PID) for the current scri

$?      # Return code of the previous command

```
- <s>"shift" in script will take out the first argument, and make $1 point to $2, $2 to $3...</s>
  - not sure the use case
### custom variable
- must not leave space when define a variable
- string sign "" is strict string, while sign '' may be interpret as variable
``` bash
name="VBird"        # no space between both side of '='
# name = "VBird" 
    # will be interpreted as calling program "name" with arguments "=" and "VBird"
echo ${name}        # "VBird"
echo '${name}'      # "VBird"
echo "${name}"      # "${name}"
```
## function declaration 
``` bash
# declare function 
mcd () {
    mkdir -p "$1"
    cd "$1"
}
# use function
mcd aa
mcd $1          # if $1 is script scope variable, it can also be passed into mcd as argument
```
- function variable: 
  - like script, function also use $0, $1, ... as internal variable
  - $0, $1, ... in function scope is **indepentent to script variable** with the same name
  - $0: name of the function
  - $1, $2... are arguments being passed into the function (when calling the function) 

## export 
- scripts execute in their own process whereas functions are executed in the current shell environment. Thus functions can modify environment variables while script cannot
- export passes variables and functions to all child processes of a script.
- use export to pass environment variables (eg, $PATH) by value is convenient so that the script can call some external command without specify the absolute path

``` bash
#!/bin/env bash
export PATH="$PATH:test"   # Temporarily add test to the environment variable PATH, only inside the script
```
# logic operations 
## 1). []/ test: conditional test
- use '[]' as conditional test, must add ' ' at both side
- 'test' can be used interchangeably with '[]'
- there is no True/Flase as datatype, neither will result be printed in screen 
  - success evaluation is $? = 0, 
  - failure is $? != 0
- however, there are 'true' and 'false' as program where
  - true always return $?=0
  - false always return $?=1
``` bash
name="VBird"
[ "${name}" == "VBird" ] && echo "VBird!" || echo "shame" 
test "${name}" == "VBird" && echo "VBird!" || echo "shame" 

# true and false program
false || echo "Oops, fail"      # "Oops, fail"
true && echo "Things went well" # "Things went well"
```
- variable in conditional test should be wrapped with "", otherwise space in the variable will be evaluated as multiple arguments!!!
``` bash
name="VBird gg"
test ${name} == "VBird" && echo "VBird!" || echo "shame"        # ERROR -bash: test: too many arguments
test "${name}" == "VBird" && echo "VBird!" || echo "shame"      #  "shame"

```


- common conditional statement |ref: 鸟哥P396|
<center>

|variable compare| meaning| 
|---|---| 
|two args |eg: test ${a} -gt ${b}|
|==, -eq|equal (== incl string)| 
|!=, -ne|not equal (!= incl string)|  
|-gt, | greater than >, | 
|-lt | less than < | 
|-ge|greater equal than >=| 
|-le|less equal than <=| 
</center>

<center>

|file exist| meaning| 
|---|---| 
|single arg|eg: test -e "fileName"|
|-e|"fileName" exist| 
|-f|"fileName" exist, and is a file| 
|-d|"fileName" exist, and is a directory| 

</center>

<center>

|file property| meaning| 
|---|---| 
|single arg|eg: test -r "fileName"| 
|-r|readable| 
|-w|writable| 
|-x|executable| 
|two args |test "fileName1" -nt "fileName2"| 
|-nt|newer than| 
|-od|older than| 
|-ef|(hardlink) point to the same file| 

</center>


### AND, OR
- inside a conditional test, use
  - "AND": -a
  - "OR": -o
- between multiple conditional test, use
  - "AND": &&
  - "OR": ||

<center>

|AND/OR| meaning| 
|---|---| 
|-a|Inside expression AND|
|-o|Inside expression OR|
|&&|outside expression AND|
|\|\||outside expression OR|

</center>

``` bash
# inside a conditional test
[ -e 'LeetCode' -a -d 'LeetCode' ] && echo "VBird!" || echo "shame"
# equivalent: between multiple conditional test
[ -e 'LeetCode' ] && [ -d 'LeetCode' ] && echo "VBird!" || echo "shame"
```

## 2). if-elif-else-then
- it is preferd to use double [[]] in if-then to prevent chance of mistakes
``` bash
if [[ cond1 ]]; then
    echo 'cond1'
elif [[ cond2 ]]; then
    echo 'cond2'
else
    echo 'cond3'
fi
```
## 3). case-esac
``` bash
case ${var} in
    "1stCase")
        echo "1st"
        ;;              # end case with ;;
    "2ndCase")
        echo "2nd"
        ;;
    *)
        echo "else"
        ;;
esac
```
#  substitutions 
## 1). $(CMD): command substitution
- $(CMD)
  -  execute CMD
  -  get the outputs of the command
  -  substitute the variable with the outputs

``` bash
# substituted variable can either be used in place or assign to a name

wspth=$(wslpath "$1")           # assign to wspth
echo "Starting program at $(date)"  # use in place (anonymous)

for file in $(ls)   # use in place (anonymous)
do
    echo "file"
done
```
## 2). <(CMD): process substitution
- <(CMD)
  -  execute CMD
  -  get the outputs of the command
  -  place outputs in a temp file 
  -  substitute <(CMD) with the name of file
- useful to use with commands that requires fileName as input arguement
``` bash
diff <(ls foo) <(ls bar)    # show differenct between contents in two directories, here diff take file name as input
```
## 3). ${} Parameter Substitution TODO
- substitute pattern in a variable with another pattern
``` bash
wspth=${wspth//' '/'\ '}
```
## 4). eval 
- eval execute command formatted as variable or string
``` bash
mycommand="wc -l department.txt"
eval $mycommand
eval "cd $wspth"
```

# iteration
## for-do-done
``` bash
# loop in a set
for animal in dog cat elephant
do
    echo "there are ${animal}s"
done

user=$(cut -d ':' -f1 /etc/passwd)  # command substitution, set contains first field in file passwd (separated by ':')
for userName in user
do
    id ${userName}
done



# loop for a number of times
for counter in $(seq 1 5)       # also command substitution
do 
    echo "the ${counter} times"
done



# C style
num=11
for ((i=1; i<=${num}; i=i+1))
do
   echo "the ${i} times"
done
``` 

## while-do-done, until-do-done
- while vs until
  - while-do-done: loop until condition not true
  - until-do-done: stop when condition become true
``` bash
# while-do-done
while [ conditionalTest ]
do
    # script
done


# until-do-done
until [ conditionalTest ]
do
    # script
done
```

# misc
- cut first/last n line from file
``` bash
head -n   # cut first n line
tail -n   # cut last n line 
```
- split directory and fileName/lastDir
``` bash
basename '/mnt/c/Users/wli20/OneDrive/Desktop/sandBox/shell' # shell

dirname '/mnt/c/Users/wli20/OneDrive/Desktop/sandBox/shell' # /mnt/c/Users/wli20/OneDrive/Desktop/sandBox
```
