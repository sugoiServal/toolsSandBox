If you primarily work with Object-Relational Mappers (ORMs) in web frameworks like Django, SQLAlchemy (for Python), or ActiveRecord (for Ruby), you may not need to become an expert in the inner workings of a specific SQL database like PostgreSQL or MySQL. However, having a good understanding of certain aspects of these databases can be helpful for optimizing your application and troubleshooting issues when they arise. Here are some aspects you might consider learning:

SQL Basics:

Understand the fundamental SQL commands like SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, and JOIN. ORM frameworks often generate SQL queries, but knowing how to write and optimize SQL queries can be valuable when you need to customize or debug database interactions.
Data Types:

Familiarize yourself with common data types supported by your chosen database system. This knowledge can help you make informed decisions about how to define your ORM models and handle data conversions.
Indexing:

Learn about indexing and how to create and manage indexes in the database. Indexes can significantly impact query performance, and knowing how to use them effectively can be crucial.
Transactions and Concurrency:

Understand how transactions work in your database system. This knowledge is essential for ensuring data consistency and handling concurrent access to the database, especially in high-traffic web applications.
Query Optimization:

Gain a basic understanding of query optimization techniques, including the use of EXPLAIN plans and profiling tools. This can help you identify and address performance bottlenecks in your database queries.
Constraints:

Learn about constraints such as primary keys, foreign keys, unique constraints, and check constraints. These constraints ensure data integrity and can be important when defining your ORM models.
Security:

Familiarize yourself with database security best practices, including user management, role-based access control, and data encryption. Ensuring the security of your database is crucial in web applications.
Backup and Recovery:

Know how to perform database backups and understand the options for disaster recovery. This knowledge can help you prepare for potential data loss scenarios.
Database-specific Features:

Depending on the database system you use (e.g., PostgreSQL or MySQL), there may be unique features and extensions. Familiarize yourself with these features, especially if they can enhance your application's capabilities.
Database Administration Tools:

Learn how to use basic database administration tools for tasks like database creation, backup, and monitoring. While this may not be your primary responsibility as a developer, it can be useful for debugging and maintaining your application in production.
