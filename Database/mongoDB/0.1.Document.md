# JSON document
- each document is one data-point 
- includes:
  - _id: 
    - 12 bytes hexadecimal number which assures the uniqueness of every document
    - provided (refer different APIs) or auto-generated
  - data format:
    - key(field) : value
  - default separator: ","
  - key name is a string. always good to use "double quote" 
```js
{
   _id: ObjectId(7df78ad8902c)
   "title": 'MongoDB Overview',           
   "description": 'MongoDB is no sql database',
   "by": 'tutorials point',
   "url": 'http://www.tutorialspoint.com',
   "tags": ['mongodb', 'database', 'NoSQL'],
   "likes": 100, 
   "comments": [	
      {
         "user":'user1',
         "message": 'My first comment',
         "dateCreated": new Date(2011,1,20,2,15),
         "like": 0 
      },
      {
         "user":'user2',
         "message": 'My second comments',
         "dateCreated": new Date(2011,1,25,7,45),
         "like": 5
      }
   ]
}
```
# BSON
- JSON in mongoDB is stored as BSON
  - BSON allow non-string objects like "_id: ObjectId(7df78ad8902c)"
  - BSON is more efficient

# Data Types
>- String − This is the most commonly used datatype to store the data. String in MongoDB must be UTF-8 valid.

>- Boolean − This type is used to store a boolean (true/ false) value.

>- Integer − This type is used to store a numerical value. Integer can be 32 bit or 64 bit depending upon your server.
  - int32 (32bits)
  - int64 (64bits)
>- Double − This type is used to store floating point values. (rounded)
>- Decimal − high decimal place precision number

>- Min/ Max keys − This type is used to compare a value against the lowest and highest BSON elements.

>- Arrays − This type is used to store arrays or list or multiple values into one key.

>- Timestamp − ctimestamp. This can be handy for recording when a document has been modified or added.
>- Date − This datatype is used to store the current date or time in UNIX time format. You can specify your own date time by creating object of Date and passing day, month, year into it.

>- Array − a list of objects
>- Document − This datatype is used for embedded documents.
>- ObjectId(_id) − This datatype is used to store the document’s ID.

>- Null − This type is used to store a Null value.

>- Symbol − This datatype is used identically to a string; however, it's generally reserved for languages that use a specific symbol type.

>- Binary data − This datatype is used to store binary data.

>- Code − This datatype is used to store JavaScript code into the document.

>- Regular expression − This datatype is used to store regular expression.

# Schema Design 
- ask yourself these questions
  1. Which data does my app need => define the fields and (vaguely) relations
  2. Where these data come from
  3. Where do I use the data, how frequent (UI, pages, functions...)
       - => define how HARD-CODE(SQL-LIKE) the field is
       - => define whether you should optimize the query process
  4. How is the data related
      - => decide whether distribute data across mulitple collections or nots 
  5. (FINALLY) design the Schema
       - => define what kind of queries you perform in apps (avoid comple join)

## Relations Reflection on MongoDB
- there are 3 types of data relations:
  - one-one
  - one-many
  - many-many
- SQL use "Reference" to reflect these relations 
- MongoDB, use "Reference" AND "Nested Documents"

### When to use "Reference"? When to use "Nested Documents"
- there is no hard boundary, always application oriented: make retrival less in the application 
  - how often the two sides are need to be fetched together? (often is "Nested")
  - which side is significantly bigger? (large MANY side shouldnt use "Nested")
### "Reference": one-one and one many
- use intuitive, just like SQL
- use foreignKey and PrimaryKey
### "Nested Documents": one-one and one many
 - one-one: Nested Documents is ideal to one-one relation, especially when one side is strong related, or OWNED by the other
   - implement as one document field
 - one-many: As long as the many side wont grow too big.
   - implement typically as Array of Nested Doc
### Many-Many

- "Reference" SQL approach: use three tables (collections) to connect the two side
  - intermediate middle-table that hold priKey of the two sides
  - customers-orders-products model
- "Nested Documents": 
  - the "middle-table" can be dstributed and stored in both of the side table as Array of Documents

```js
// customer
{
  // customer meta data
  _id : ObjectId("507f191e810c19729de860ea"),      
  name: 'Max',
  age: 1997,
  // the "middle-table"
  orders: [ 
    {
      productID: ObjectId("62c1a47bd9d3fce4f962c8d2"),  // foreign key
      quantity: 12        // customer related meta data (also belonged to the middle-table)
    },
    {
      productID: ObjectId("62c1a47bd9d3fce4f962c8d3"),
      quantity: 42
    },
  ]
}

// product
{
    // customer meta data
  _id : ObjectId("507f191e810c19729de860ec"),      
  name: 'monster drink',
  price: 3,
  // the "middle-table"
  orders: [ 
    {
      customerID: ObjectId("62c1a47bd9d3fce4f962c8x2"),  // foreign key
      quantity: 12        // customer related meta data (also belonged to the middle-table)
    },
    {
      productID: ObjectId("62c1a47bd9d3fce4f962c8x3"),
      quantity: 42
    },
  ]
}
```
# Schema Validation
- Schema Validation Pipeline
>  Set validationLevel => conduct write action => validation => validationAction
- validationLevel (What kind of action will be validated)
  - strict: Insert and Update
  - other: skip

- validationAction (what to do when valiation fail)
  - Throw error and deny
  - accept but log warning


## Create Schema Validation
- Schema Validation is created through create Collection explicitly
```js
db.createCollection('posts', {
  validator: {
    $jsonSchema: {
      bsonType: 'object',
      required: ['title', 'text', 'creator', 'comments'],   // adding Object(Document) must AT LAEST have these fields
      properties: {
        title: {
          bsonType: 'string',
          description: 'must be a string and is required'
        },
        text: {
          bsonType: 'string',
          description: 'must be a string and is required'
        },
        creator: {
          bsonType: 'objectId',
          description: 'must be an objectid and is required'
        },
        comments: {
          bsonType: 'array',
          description: 'must be an array and is required',
          items: {
            bsonType: 'object',
            required: ['text', 'author'],
            properties: {
              text: {
                bsonType: 'string',
                description: 'must be a string and is required'
              },
              author: {
                bsonType: 'objectId',
                description: 'must be an objectid and is required'
              }
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
  //validationAction:"error"    // default
  validationAction:"warn"     
});
```


## Modify Validator
```js
db.runCommand(
  {
    collMod: "posts",     // the collection to be modify
    validator: {...}      // new validator
  }
)
```
