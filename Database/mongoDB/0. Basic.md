# What is MongoDB
- a noSQL DB, 
  - storing JSON data (BSON: on server mongoDB convert JSON into binary BSON data)
  - more freedom & flexibility
    - documents are schemaless, can store different set of fields
    - no/ few relations, update won't involve multiple tables; Eliminate complex join
    - faster read/write, optimal for **io heavy** application, **big data**, etc
    - Horizontal Scalability

- structure:
  - MongoDB server (hold multiple DB) 
    - Database (set of collections) 
      - Collection (group of documents) 
        - document (JSON like)

- SQL equivalent

- MongoDB ecosystem:
  - local Database (community/enterprise)
  - Atlas: Cloud solution
  - Compass: GUI
  - BI Connector, MongoDB Charts: BA/Data Science solution
  - Stitch: backend Database-releted toolkits


# install in Windows(cli interface)
1. install server
   > https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community
    - no need to config the installer
2. install better shell(msi)
   > https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/shell
3. install MongoDB Tools
   > https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/database-tools
4. setup with microsoft terminal (mongosh.exe)

# mongo and mongod    
![](https://imgur.com/mYnyXY3.jpg)
- let's say everything related to Mongodb is either belongs to application or belongs the server
- application
  - your application (say a web app) belongs to application. when the application need data (CRUD), it need to use drivers (AKA APIs) to communicate with the Mongodb server, and then the server process the requests
  - the Mongodb user interface (mongo, mongosh; aka mongo cli) are also applications, the main purpose of these UI is to conduct **Admin operations**

- server
  - server (aka mongod) it's the engine that store the data, and performed all the underlying code to CRUD data efficiently. Including: I/O to external requests, Data, Storage/Retrieve Engine (Algorithms& Implements)...
  - "mongod" command run the server as a processor

- communication: Applications and server communicate through a specified ports number (either remote or local)
```bash
# start server
    sudo mangod                       # start the server with default port
    sudo mangod --port <port>         # start the server with specified port

# connect mongo cli through port
    mongo --port <port> 
    mongosh --port <port> 
```

- side note: in Windows distribution, the server is installed as a service of the system, so there's no need manually start the process through "mongod" Command. whereas in Linux user/admin need to manually start the engine.

# setup server
>[Docs about configuartion file](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/configuration-options/)
```bash
./bin/mongod.cfg
```

> [Docs about mongod flags](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/program/mongod/)
- useful mongod flags:
  - --help : list all flags
  - --quiet: warning behavior
  - --dbpath: data path
  - --logpath: log file path
  - --repair: db file corrupted problems solution
  - --directoryperdb: wheter create a folder for each db
  - --fork --logpath: start mongodb as a background service (active listen), with specific log file
  - --config, -f: start mongodb with a configuration file setting
```js
// shutdown mongodb as a service
use admin
db.shutdownServer() 
```
# misc
## naming restricion
- case-sensitive
- windows deployment: no
>  /\. "$*<>:|?
- unix/linux deployment: no
>  /\. "$
