# Atomicity
- mongodb ensure Single Documents **Insertion/Update/Deletion** is atomic
- Even there is error, there will never be any "half-documents" in the database. In other word, document level error will be rolled-back
- Many() Insertion/Update/Deletion, however, is not atomitic.
# Transaction
- for non atomic action, such as updating/deleting related data in multiple collection, "Transaction" ensures rollback when error would happens
```js
const session = db.getMongo().startSession()
session.startTransaction()
const usersCollection =  session.getDatabase("blog").users
const postsCollection =  session.getDatabase("blog").posts

// write a series of operations to these collections, all within session, and these commands will not be executed before commit
usersCollection.<insert, find, delete, update...>

// commit/ abort transaction
usersCollection.commitTransaction()
usersCollection.abortTransaction()
```
