# Indexes
> [Offical Docs](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/indexes/)
- What is Indexes:
  - a cache, a list created by user storing pointers to target documents, and got maintained by the server
  - For faster query to frequently queried fields
- When query/sort, if indexes of a collection exists, the server firstly perform IndexScan and fetch, the CollectionScan will be backup plan
- For example. in a large collection products, queries by field "seller" like
  
```js
db.products.find({seller:"Max"})
```

is often conducted. to avoid whole collection scan each time perform this kind of query, we can create indexes grouping by field "seller". In each seller-index there are pointers to documents with the corresponding field value.
### limitation
- the trade-off from using indexes is slower insertion (for adding to indexes) and storage 
- also, index won't improve performance when the queries would return most to the documents in a collection: CollectionScan will be faster than IndexScan + fetch 


## properties
- support:
  - field
  - set of fields
  - subfields in Array/Embedded Doc
- support different value types:
  - Array, Text, Geospatial, Hash...
- in indexes, values are always sorted
- MongoDB indexes use a B-tree data structure
  
## IN ACTION

### create indexs

- create an (compound) index
> [createIndex() ref](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/method/db.collection.createIndex/)
```js
db.collection.createIndex( <key and index type specification>, <options> )
db.products.createIndex(
  { item: 1, quantity: -1 } ,          // 1st field: item(asec), 2nd field: quantity(desc)
  { name: "query for inventory" }      // Option Doc, includes custom Index name, default name is: "item_1_quantity_-1
)

// when there is an compound index, if only query the first field individually, indexScan will be used. If only query the second (or 3rd...) field, indexScan will not be used!!
// to use indexScan in an compound index, when query any field, the fields before it must ALL be also queried
```




- show indexes in a collection
```js
db.collection.getIndexes()
```
- drop index
```js
db.products.dropIndex()
```
### options

|option|type||
|--|--|--|
|name|string|The name of the index|
|unique|boolean|AKA a UNIQUE KEY. Creates a unique index so that the collection will not accept insertion or update of documents where the index key value matches an existing value in the index.|
|partialFilterExpression|document|If specified, the index only references(ie stores) documents that match the filter expression (same to query operators). See [Partial Indexes](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/core/index-partial/) for more information.  |
|expireAfterSeconds|integer| ONLY for data-type-field. In seconds, as a TTL(time to live) to control how long MongoDB retains documents in this collection|
|background|boolean|Directs MongoDB to build the index in the background. Background builds do not block operations on the collection|

- use unique and partialFilterExpression
  - unique index allows unique field in a collection. And the field should be NOT EMPTY (must exist) 
  - use unique and partialFilterExpression in conjunction allows unique OR non exist field
```js
// all user document must have email and must be unique 
db.user.createIndex(
    {email:1},
    {unique: true})

// users' document can have no email, if they have, the email must be unique
db.user.createIndex(
    {email:1},
    {
        unique: true,
        partialFilterExpression: {email: {$exists: true}}
    })
```
- TTL document: use expireAfterSeconds
```js
// create TTL field: createdAt, expireAfterSeconds: 10
db.sessions.createIndex({createdAt:1}, {expireAfterSeconds: 10})

// 10 seconds after the insertion, this document will gone 
db.sessions.insertOne({
    data: "adfsdfs",
    createdAt:new Date()
})

```

- background: Adding Indexes in the background
  - when explicitly adding indexes with createIndex(), the collection will be lock from access until index creation done
  - sometimes a collection has active IO and cannot be locked to long, thus we need to add indexes in the background(without lock)
  - Background builds do not block operations on the collection
```js
db.sessions.createIndex({createdAt:1}, {background: true})
```



### multikey index
- when create Index on Array or Document (or combination) , MongoDB create [Multikey Index](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/indexes/#multikey-index) automatically
- multikey index will be **significantly larger** than oridinary Index, because Mongodb create index for all value within these compound types
- "compound index" of multiple "multikey index" is forbidden

### Text Index
- text index is a special kind of multikey index, it turned a string type field into an array of "keywords" and create multikey index upon it.
- Text Index would generally be faster than RegExp
- **One data Collection can only have one text index**. However it is possible to [combine several string fields](####combined-text-index) into one text index search list 
```js
db.products.createIndex({description:"text"})
db.products.insertOne({title:"a Book", description:"This is an awesome book"})
db.products.find({$text: {$search: "awesome", $caseSensitive:true}})   // find document that contain word "awesome" in description, caseSensitive (default: false)
db.products.find({$text: {$search: "\"awesome book\""}})   // find document that contain a phrase (include space), by wrap the phrase with " (escaped with \)
db.products.find({$text: {$search: "awesome book"}})  // find document whose description contains "awesome" or "book" ("awesome book" is treated as array) 
db.products.find({$text: {$search: "awesome -book"}})  // find document whose description contains "awesome" but not include "book" (minus "book)

```
#### Combined Text Index
- to let multiple string-type-fields share the text index (Combined Text Index), simple declare them when createIndex
```js
db.products.createIndex({description:"text", title:"text"})
```

- it is possible to get a "score" of word match (how good is a match) in find
```js
db.products.find({$text: {$search: "awesome book"}}, {score:{$meta:"textScore"}}).sort({score:{$meta:"textScore"}})  

// also when define Combined Text Index it is possible to specify a weight to each field
db.products.createIndex({description:"text", title:"text"}), {weights: {title:1, description:10}}
```

## Query & Indexes Diagnosis
### "explain()" tool give summary to a query
```jd
js.user.explain(<explainType>).find()
```
- \<explainType>:
  - "queryPlanner":show summary for executed query + Winning Plan
  - "executionStats": show detail for executed query + Winning Plan + Rejected Plans 
  - "allPlansExecution": show detail for executed query + Winning Plan + Winning Plan Decision Process
