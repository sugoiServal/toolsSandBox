# Views

- what is view:
  - turn **query result** into a table like object, where you can use the result like a table, eg, query again (**query the query result**)
    - view can be nested, a view may be built from a query of another view
  - view stores no data, each time view is used the data should be retrieval from else where
    - which means time complxity, especially deeply nested views, complex query views...
    - also means when data is modified in original tables, the views will return that changed data.
- when to use VIEW: reusable
  - use view with highly reusable queries
- create view

```SQL
-- CREATE VIEW ... AS (query)
CREATE VIEW ProductCustomers AS
    SELECT cust_name, cust_contact, prod_id
    FROM Customers, Orders, OrderItems
    WHERE Customers.cust_id = Orders.cust_id
    AND OrderItems.order_num = Orders.order_num;
-- DROP VIEW
DROP VIEW ProductCustomers;
