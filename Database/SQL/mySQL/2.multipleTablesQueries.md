# Subqueries(chaining queries)

- Why: Work with multiple tables, use info from one table to aid query of another table
- Property:
    - Subqueries are always processed starting with the innermost SELECT statement and working outward.
    - using subqueries have **performance issue**, and sometimes **can be repalced by Joining Table**
  
## 1) FIRST USE: filter query with the result of another query (a list of value)

  - the result of inner query SHOULD:
    - inner query result should be compatible with the outer filter column
    - inner query MUST only retrieve a single column (a list of value)

- eg
``` SQL
SELECT cust_name, cust_contact FROM Customers
WHERE cust_id IN (
        SELECT cust_id
        FROM Orders
        WHERE order_num IN (
            SELECT order_num
            FROM OrderItems
            WHERE prod_id ='RGAN01'
        )
    );
-- same query using inner join
SELECT Customers.cust_name, Customers.cust_contact
FROM Customers, Orders, OrderItems
WHERE Customers.cust_id = Orders.cust_id
AND OrderItems.order_num = Orders.order_num
AND prod_id ='RGAN01';

```


## 2) SECOND USE: subquery as a column of data, which is mapped from nested table to current table 

- eg
``` SQL
SELECT cust_name, cust_state, 
   (SELECT COUNT(*)  
    FROM Orders 
    WHERE Orders.cust_id = Customers.cust_id) AS orders  
    -- WHERE Orders.cust_id = Customers.cust_id ensure the field value match
FROM Customers
ORDER BY cust_name;

-- in the subquery, it actually provide Customers.cust_id(an Array of data) and loop through it in Orders Table. It is actually a mapping from Customers.cust_id to an array NumOrders corresponding to each cust_id
    -- ForEach Customers.cust_id, 
        -- Count in Number of orders in Order, if the Orders.cust_id matches Customers.cust_id
        -- return as single value in the 'orders' column 

```

# Joining Tables
## Data distribute rules
### One to One, One to Many and Many to Many
  - 1:1 relation
    - 1 to 1 related data should belongs to one table, with a **Primary Key**
    - eg: User name, user ID, user password
  - 1:n relation
    - 1 to many related data distributes across different tables, linked by **Foreign Key**
    - eg: user (owns multi) posts, user (owns multi) orders...
    - posts table: userKey, order table: userKey...
  - n:n relation:
    - 
## Joining Property

- Joining is essential tool to retrieve data from multiple related tables
- Property:
  - join is a temporary table, created as per the instruction to combine multiple tables, and only exist durning the query execution 
- To create join: 
  - provide all tables to include by FROM
  - instruct how they are related by WHERE

## different types of Join techniques
### cross join (Cartesian Product)
- set union two table
- without any filter, the result is always incorrect
``` SQL
SELECT Vendors.vend_name, Products.prod_name, Products.prod_price
FROM Vendors, Products
```
### inner join
- set intersection through foreign key
- a join based on the testing of equality (of a field) between two tables
  - essentially, cross join two tables and filter by the equality statement
- can become very resource intensive, be careful not to join tables unnecessarily. The more tables you join, the more performance will degrade.
- eg
  
``` SQL
SELECT Vendors.vend_name, Products.prod_name, Products.prod_price
FROM Vendors, Products
WHERE Vendors.vend_id = Products.vend_id;
-- another syntax explicit state INNER JOIN
SELECT Vendors.vend_name, Products.prod_name, Products.prod_price
FROM Vendors
INNER JOIN Products ON Vendors.vend_id = Products.vend_id;
-- Inner Join Multiple
  -- for all products in order 20007, list prodName, vendName, prodPrice, and quantity
SELECT Vendors.vend_name, Products.prod_name, Products.prod_price, OrderItems.quantity
FROM OrderItems, Products, Vendors
WHERE Products.vend_id = Vendors.vend_id
AND OrderItems.prod_id = Products.prod_id 
AND order_num =20007;

```
### outer join
- https://www.cuemath.com/algebra/operations-on-sets/
- set difference through foreign key
  - left join: A - B
  - right join: B - A

- outer join: inner join, but (+) includes all table rows in a table that (may) have no associated rows in the other table


- eg
``` SQL
-- inner join:
  -- retrieve a list of customers-order_id pair, cust_id from Customers must appear > 1 times in Orders  
SELECT Customers.cust_id, Orders.order_id
FROM Customers 
INNER JOIN Orders ON Customers.cust_id = Orders.cust_id;

-- left outer join:
  -- left: include all rows from left table (Customers)
  -- retrieve a list of customers-order_id pair, although cust_id from Customers may not appear in Orders, (and in the output, #cust_id_rows > #order_id_id_rows, empty order_id display NULL)
SELECT Customers.cust_id, Orders.order_id
FROM Customers 
LEFT OUTER JOIN Orders ON Customers.cust_id = Orders.cust_id;

-- right outer join:
  -- right: include all rows from right table (Orders)
  -- retrieve a list of customers-order_id pair, although cust_id from Orders may not appear in Customers, (and in the output, #order_id_rows > #cust_id_rows, empty cust_id display NULL)
SELECT Customers.cust_id, Orders.order_id
FROM Customers 
RIGHT OUTER JOIN Orders ON Customers.cust_id = Orders.cust_id;
``` 
- left and right join are the same operation if you change the order
``` SQL
SELECT * FROM customers
LEFT JOIN orders
    ON customers.id = orders.customer_id;
-- is equivalent to
SELECT * FROM orders
RIGHT JOIN customers
    ON customers.id = orders.customer_id;    
```
### IFNULL():
- IFNULL(field, expression);
  - IFNULL() take two arguments, it return field value is it is not null, otherwise it return expression
- eg: use IFNULL() with Outer Join
``` SQL
SELECT
    students.first_name,
    IFNULL(papers.title, 'MISSING'),
    IFNULL(papers.grade, 0)
FROM students
LEFT JOIN papers
    ON students.id = papers.student_id;
```


### with GROUP BY:
- same example as outer join:
``` SQL
-- num_ord > 0
SELECT Customers.cust_id, COUNT(Orders.order_num) AS num_ord
FROM Customers
INNER JOIN Orders ON Customers.cust_id = Orders.cust_id
GROUP BY Customers.cust_id;

-- including num_ord == 0
SELECT Customers.cust_id, COUNT(Orders.order_num) AS num_ordFROM Customers LEFT OUTER JOIN Orders ON Customers.cust_id = Orders.cust_id 
GROUP BY Customers.cust_id;
```

## Not That important:
### self join
- essentially inner join but with only one table: it join to itself, and filter through a field it own
- Self joins often replace subquery in this usage: many DBMSs process joins far more quickly than they do subqueries
``` SQL
SELECT c1.cust_id, c1.cust_name, c1.cust_contact
FROM Customers AS c1, Customers AS c2
WHERE c1.cust_name = c2.cust_name
AND c2.cust_contact ='Jim Jones';
-- same query in subquery
SELECT cust_id, cust_name, cust_contact
FROM Customers
WHERE cust_name =(SELECT cust_name
                  FROM Customers
                  WHERE cust_contact ='Jim Jones');

```
### natural join
- in Inner Join, if you **SELECT the column used to create the join** (eg, primary key), the column will appear > 2 times in the result
- To eliminate those multiple occurrences of the same column, using a wildcard (SELECT *) for one table and explicit subsets of the columns for all other tables.
- eg
``` SQL
  SELECT C.*, O.order_num, O.order_date, OI.prod_id, OI.quantity, OI.item_price
  FROM Customers AS C, Orders AS O, OrderItems AS OI
```
# MANY to MANY relation
- when deal with n:n relation, a third table is needed to connect the two subjects: store foreign key to both table
- common n:n example:
  - book <-> author (co-author, author's different work)
  - blog post <-> hashTags (multiple tag post; posts in a tag)
  - Students <-> Courses (student take multiple course, course has different students)
  - IMDB: User <-> Series (User have multiple review/rate, series have multiple review/rate)
- to find relationship of the two subject with a third subject:
  - BookAuthor: (FOREIGN)book_id, (FOREIGN)author_id
  - PostTag: (FOREIGN)post_id, (FOREIGN)tag_name
  - Taker: (FOREIGN)student_id, (FOREIGN)course_id
  - Review: (FOREIGN)user_id, (FOREIGN)series_id, review, rating

- **JOINING 3 tables**

``` SQL
-- reviewers JOIN reviews JOIN series
SELECT
	series.title AS 'title',
	reviews.rating AS 'rating',
	CONCAT(reviewers.first_name, ' ', reviewers.last_name) AS 'reviewer'
FROM reviewers
INNER JOIN reviews ON reviewers.id = reviews.reviewer_id
INNER JOIN series ON reviews.series_id = series.id
ORDER BY title; 

--and series JOIN reviews JOIN reviewers is the same result
SELECT
	series.title AS 'title',
	reviews.rating AS 'rating',
	CONCAT(reviewers.first_name, ' ', reviewers.last_name) AS 'reviewer'
FROM series
INNER JOIN reviews ON series.id = reviews.series_id 
INNER JOIN reviewers ON reviews.reviewer_id = reviewers.id
ORDER BY title; 
```

# Combining Queries: UNION and INTERSECT
- Simple, what it is: display multiple queries in a single result (by UNION(+) or INTERSECT(-) them)
  - UNION: combine both queries in one output set
  - INTERSECT: retrieve only the rows that exist in both queries
- Intuitive, What is the restriction: 
  - Each query must contain the same columns, same expressions, same aggregate functions, OR AT LEAST same number of columns with compatible datatypes (better in the same order)
- code
``` SQL
SELECT cust_name, cust_contact, cust_email
FROM Customers
WHERE cust_state IN('IL','IN','MI')
UNION
SELECT cust_name, cust_contact, cust_email
FROM Customers
WHERE cust_name ='Fun4All';
```
- modifier:
  - ALL: 
    - UNION automatically(default) removes any duplicate rows from the unioned queries
    - use UNION ALL allow duplicated result
  - SORT BY: add SORT BY at the final query to sort the whole output
    - multiple ORDER BY clauses are not allowed.
