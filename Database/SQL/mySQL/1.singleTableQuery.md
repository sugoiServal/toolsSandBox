### SELECT FROM

- `SELECT (DISTINCT) <cols...> FROM <table>`
- `LIMIT 6 OFFSET 5`: select 6 rows (skip 5 row)
- `WHERE <col> <condition/wildcard>`: filtering

  - SORT BY comes after WHERE
  - either use logical filter conditions, or wildcard (LIKE), or RegularExpression (REGEXP_LIKE)

- filter conditions

  | -------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
  | \_       | match single character                              |
  | %        | match arbitrary number of characters (including "") |
  | []       | match a set of characters (single position)         |
  | ^        | negate a wildcard                                   |
  | NOT LIKE | negate like (outside of the match set)              |
  | \        | escape sign                                         |

- `ORDER BY <col> (ASC/DESC)`: sort, default ASC. Can use multiple columns separated by ','

- `SELECT <expression(cols)> FROM <table> AS <alias>`

  - computed value of cols from expression. Return as the name alias.
  - logical expressions: `CASE-END`; `WHEN-THEN-ELSE`; `BETWEEN-AND`
  - arithmetic expressions: `+-*/`

- `SELECT <aggregation(cols)> FROM <table>`

  - aggregate functions:
    - multiple input args, single output value
    - NULL values are generally expected to be ignored in aggregate functions

  | sign                                | meaning                                                                |
  | ----------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
  | DISTINCT                            | distince values in aggregate function: SELECT AVG(DISTINCT prod_price) |
  | AVG(), SUM(), COUNT(), MAX(), MIN() | statistics                                                             |

- `SELECT <col..., aggregation()> GROUP BY <col...> HAVING <condition/wildcard>`

  - execution order: SELECT col... => (WHERE) => GROUP BY => HAVING => SELECT aggregation()
  - `GROUP BY` divide data to subsets of distinct values (groups)
    - any column in the SELECT statement can be present in the GROUP BY
    - GROUP BY col1, col2 (multiple columns) means putting distinct col1&col2 combination to a group
    - aggregate functions is applied after grouping
  - `HAVING` is the WHERE clause for groups
    - HAVING can use condition/wildcard just like WHERE
    - WHERE filters before data is grouped, HAVING filters after data is grouped. GROUP BY and HAVING must come after WHERE clause
