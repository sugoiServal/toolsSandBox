# Atomicity
- mongodb ensure Single Documents **Insertion/Update/Deletion** is atomic
- Even there is error, there will never be any "half-documents" in the database. In other word, document level error will be rolled-back
- Many() Insertion/Update/Deletion, however, is not atomitic.
# Transaction
- for non atomic action, such as updating/deleting related data in multiple collection, "Transaction" ensures rollback when error would happens
- TODO
# writeConcern
