1- Could you tell us a bit of yourself ? (2,30)
> keep it relevant to job position and talk maximum 3 minutes.

- you can call me Evan
- i am a computer science master graduated from University of ottawa last year, 
- I've been coding in C++ and python and some java since my undergrad, 
- durning the grad school, I write python script to run Deep learning and machine learning experiments and ploting most of the time, also did an modern C++ computer vision graduation project.

- I been learning web developments for one and a half years after finishing the grad project. 
- current my stack focus on the nodejs ecosystem, i'm also interested in learning Java or python backend ecosystem. i'd say that I'm comfortable right now writing back APIs, front end UI with react, using web services, database CURD, etc 

i've learned the concept and tools in devOps and have used some of them in my own projects. unfortunately I haven't had any chance to be a part of any real developing team so I'm desperately want to have some first hand experience on the modern SDE workflow.



- I'd say I'm still actively learning in this field And growing at fast pace. I just started to prepare for an entry level AWS certification test.

- besides web, I also have some experience in machine learning and statistics, data wrangling, Deep learning research, academic writing, applying machine learnign or statistical models and data and model visualization.

    - limit resources time, manage complexity, work in due pressure
  - i prefer learn by doing:
    - First I get myself a brief idea of what a tool's capable of doing, Its properties its components and what kind of role it play in a big picture 
    - Then I start write some demo little projects with the new tool to see how it is used as a programmer, maybe trying to see if I can integrate the tool to one of the other projects I have done
    - Finally there must be a lot of details or additional features, and their integration to other tools, these will required too many times learn. I was generally just left them and move on to the next tool. until when I have the demands to actually use these features will I go back to them
