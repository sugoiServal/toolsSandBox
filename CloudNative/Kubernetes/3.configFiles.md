### declarative kubernetes configuration

- configuration is declarative, user define the desired running state, kubernetes constantly compare the current state of the service and fix problems automatically if **"status != spec"**
- the current state comes from **etcd process** of the master node
- config script (infrastructure as code) is stored in .yaml file
