- [etcd](https://etcd.io/) is a standalone project `used` by kubernetes

### install

- [install](https://etcd.io/docs/v3.5/install/)

```bash
# install pre-built binaries: https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/releases/
ETCD_VER=v3.4.27

# choose either URL
GOOGLE_URL=https://storage.googleapis.com/etcd
DOWNLOAD_URL=${GOOGLE_URL}

rm -f /tmp/etcd-${ETCD_VER}-linux-amd64.tar.gz
rm -rf /tmp/etcd-download-test && mkdir -p /tmp/etcd-download-test

curl -L ${DOWNLOAD_URL}/${ETCD_VER}/etcd-${ETCD_VER}-linux-amd64.tar.gz -o /tmp/etcd-${ETCD_VER}-linux-amd64.tar.gz
tar -xzvf /tmp/etcd-${ETCD_VER}-linux-amd64.tar.gz -C /tmp/etcd-download-test --strip-components=1
mv /tmp/etcd-download-test /user/local/bin
rm -f /tmp/etcd-${ETCD_VER}-linux-amd64.tar.gz


echo 'export PATH=/tmp/etcd-download-test:$PATH' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

### Usage

```bash
export ETCDCTL_API=3

  # Interact with etcd, a highly-available key-value pair store.
  # More information: https://etcd.io/docs/latest/dev-guide/interacting_v3/.

  # - Display the value associated with a specified key:
    etcdctl get my/key

  # - Store a key-value pair:
    etcdctl put my/key my_value

  # - Delete a key-value pair:
    etcdctl del my/key

  # - Store a key-value pair, reading the value from a file:
    etcdctl put my/file < path/to/file.txt

  # - Save a snapshot of the etcd keystore:
    etcdctl snapshot save path/to/snapshot.db

  # - Restore a snapshot of an etcd keystore (restart the etcd server afterwards):
    etcdctl snapshot restore path/to/snapshot.db

  # - Add a user:
    etcdctl user add my_user

  # - Watch a key for changes:
    etcdctl watch my/key
```

# ETCDCTL

- [use etcd, etcd backup/restore](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/configure-upgrade-etcd/)

- `API Version`

  - etcd has two api version (2 or 3). Choose either one to use

- ETCD cluster member

```bash
etcdctl --help

# either of the command check api version
etcdctl version
etcdctl --version
# change api version: export the ETCDCTL_API variable
export ETCDCTL_API=3

# list cluster member
ps -aux | grep etcd
etcdctl member list \
  --endpoints=<--listen-client-urls> \
  --cacert=<--trusted-ca-file> \
  --cert=<--cert-file>
  --key=<--key-file>
```

- change etcd process flags

```bash
vi /etc/systemd/system/etcd.service
# edit the flags

# restart daemon
systemctl daemon-reload
systemctl restart etcd
systemctl status etcd
```

# ETCD in K8S

- [etcd HA](https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/production-environment/tools/kubeadm/ha-topology/)

- install etcd

  - When setting up the K8s from scratch, you download/install the etcd, then register it to the K8S services.
  - if use kubeadm, etcd is set up for you

- etcd Topology
  - Stacked ETCD: a topology where etcd is stacked on top of controlplane nodes.
  - External etcd: a topology where the etcd is external to controlplane nodes

## HA setup

- distributed etcd, run in a Active-Active mode

  - any etcd instance store a sync copy of the data
  - any etcd instance can read or write
  - write is done through a leader election process
    - a write request comes
    - etcd instances perform a leader election process, a leader is elected
    - the leader process the write, And is responsible for distributing the data to all nodes
    - a write is consider done Only when all nodes acknowledge that they have received and processed the write

- number of etcd node should be odd, and >= 3 (3, 5, 7...)
