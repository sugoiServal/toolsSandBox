# Kubelet

### config files

`--config`: Specifies the path to the kubelet configuration file.
`--bootstrap-kubeconfig`: The kubeconfig file used by the kubelet for cluster bootstrap. This is used during the node registration process.
`--kubeconfig`: The path to the kubeconfig file that the kubelet uses to communicate with the Kubernetes control plane.

```bash
ps -aux | grep kubelet
```

### Static Pods

- [doc](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/static-pod/)
- [udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/certified-kubernetes-administrator-with-practice-tests/learn/lecture/14863335#overview)

- Static Pods: Static Pods are managed directly by the `kubelet`

  - `API server is not involved` in the management lifecycle of static Pods.
  - use case:
    - `manually deploy controlplane components` (etcd/apiserver/controllermanager) in master nodes
    - Run node Initialization/ Bootstrapping logic
    - Use in environment where no API server(eg, cannot connect to master node) available

- How:

  - place pod definition in `/etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-apiserver.yaml`
  - Configure kubelet on the node to use this directory: `--pod-manifest-path`
  - kubelet automatically start the pod and manage the pod's lifecycle (create/restart/remove if file deleted)

- notes
  - static pod has the node name in the end of its name (eg; controlplane: kube-apiserver-controlplane)

```bash
# find out the static pod manifest directory
ps -aux | grep kubelet   # --config=/var/lib/kubelet/config.yaml
cat /var/lib/kubelet/config.yaml
# staticPodPath: /etc/kubernetes/manifests
```
