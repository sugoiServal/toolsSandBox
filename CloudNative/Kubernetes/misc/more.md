Operators: In the context of Kubernetes (often abbreviated as K8s), operators are a specific pattern for managing and automating complex, stateful applications on the Kubernetes platform. Operators are typically implemented as custom controllers that extend the functionality of the Kubernetes API to manage and operate applications that require more than just basic deployment and scaling, especially stateful applications like databases, message queues, and other complex services.
