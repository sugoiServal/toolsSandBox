# AWS pricing model
- 4 pricing models
    - `Pay as you go`: pay for what you use, meet scale demands
    - `Save when you reserve`: minimize risks, predictably manage budget, comply with long-terms requirements. `Reserved`
        - `EC2, DynomaDB, ElastiCache, RDS, Redshift`
    - `using more discounts`: volume-based discounts
    - `AWS scale economy discounts`: discounts when AWS grow the infrasturcture


## Free services
Free services & free tier in AWS
 - IAM
 - VPC
 - `Consolidated Billing`
 - Free but pay for the resource that you create:
    - `Elastic Beanstalk`
    - `CloudFormation`
    - `Auto Scaling Groups`
 - Free Tier: https://aws.amazon.com/free/
    - EC2 t2.micro instance for a year
    - S3, EBS, ELB, AWS Data transfer

## EC2 Pricing
- pricing factors (`per second, min 1 minute`):
    - Number of instances
    - Instance configuration (region, computataion capacity, os, softwawre..)
    - ELB running time and amount of data processed
    - CloudWatch monitoring frequency

- EC2 pricing plans:
    - On-Demand: come and staying in the resort whenever we like and pay the full price
    - Reserved: plan a ahead how long to stay, if the saying duration is long enough, we might get a good discount. 1-3 years commitment, up to 75% discount.
    - Saving Plan: we know how much we want to spend(pay certain amount for a period) and want to spend it all. Can stay in any type of room, flex size.
    - Spot Instances: hotel allows people the bid for any empty room at low price, if you fail the bid you will be kick out anytime
    - Dedicated host: book an entire server
    - Capacity Reservations: book room so I can have availability to the room at a period of time, I will be bill even though I don't check in

|option|workload|price|
|-|-|-|
|On-Demand| short term and un-interrupted workloads|Highest|
|Reserved|steady-state app, database...|Discount by reserve time, upfront payment|
|Saving Plan|steady-state app, database...|discount based on usage and upfront |
|Spot Instances|failure resilitent jobs, not database or critical job|cheapest|
|Dedicated Hosts/instance|specific request|same as On-Demand|
|Capacity Reservations|need 100% availability for a time|same as On-Demand|

## Lambda 
- pay per `API call`
- pay per `duration*computation resource`

## ECS(container) pricing
- pay for EC2 resources created for the ECS container

## Fargate(serverless container) pricing
- pay for resources (CPU, memory) for the container

## S3 pricing (EFS is similar): pay per use of storage volumn
- `Storage class`: S3 Standard, S3 Infrequent Access, S3 One-Zone IA, S3
Intelligent Tiering, S3 Glacier and S3 Glacier Deep Archive
- `Number and size of object`s: Price can be tiered
- `requests`
- `Data transfer`:
    - to other region
    - transfer out of S3 (`in data is free`)
    - `Transfer aceleration`

## EBS: provisioned storage volumn
- volumn types e (based on performance)
- volumn in GB, per month

- IOPS: 
  - General Purpose SSD: Included • Provisioned IOPS SSD: Provisionned amount in IOPS 
  - Magnetic: Number of requests 

- Snapshots: Snapshots are `added cost in GB` per month.
- Data transfer: 
    - transfer out of EBS, tiered for discount (`in data is free`)

## RDS pricing
- `Per hour billing`
- Database: Engine, Size, Memory class
- Purchase type:
    - On-demand
    - `Reserved instances` (1 or 3 years) with required up-front
- Backup Storage:
    - no charge until 100% of total db storage for a region
- Number of `IO requests` per month
- `Deployment`: single AZ or `multiple AZs`
- data transfer: transfer out of DB (`in data is free`)

## CloudFront (CDN) pricing
- `region where contents are served`
- `data volumn being served` (data out of cloudFront)
- `#HTTP/HTTPs requests`
- `aggregated bill` for all edge location

## Networking Costs
- bill /GB data transfer for different network types

# Savings Plan
- Setup commitments on AWS: $ amount per hour for 1/3 years, and upfront payment
    - resource free to choose during the agreement 
    - not matter how much you use (less or more)
### `EC2 Saving` plan
- up to 72% saving
- limits:
    - EC2
    - a `families of instance` `in a region`
- options 
    - arbitrary AZ, size, os, tenancy(shared/dedicated host)
    - upfront payment

### `Compute Saving plan`: most flexible
- up to 66% saving
- options:
    - compute services: EC2, Fargate, Lambda
    - families of instance, regions
    - arbitrary AZ, size, os, tenancy(shared/dedicated host)
### `Machine Learning Saving plan`: SageMaker

# Misc
## IAM
- `Never` login IAM with credientials in any EC2 Instances, instead, attach IAM role to EC2 Instance
- user groups can only contain users, `no nested groups`

## Security
### Penetration Testing on AWS
- `Penetration Testing`:  `test security` of your own system `by trying to attack`
- AWS `allows some` services to be penetration tested while `prohibits others`. Better `consult AWS`
- prohibit:
    - DNS zone walking via Route 53
    - DDoS, flooding

### Types of Customer Master Keys: CMK
- `Customer Managed` CMK:
    - Create, manage and used` by the customer`
    - advanced features: key-rotation, External key source, CloudHSM...
    - cost money per key
- `AWS managed `CMK
    - Created, managed and used on the customer’s behalf `by AWS`, but `owned by customer`
    - `user dont access the keys`
    - Used by AWS services (s3, ebs, redshift...)

- CloudHSM Keys (`custom keystore`): 
    - Keys generated `from your own CloudHSM hardware` device
    - Cryptographic operations are performed in AWS CloudHSM cluster

- `AWS owned` CMK:
    - AWS use these keys to protect users (multiple account), but no user can view/use these keye 

## Data
### Durability vs Availability
- Durability: how rare you are expected to lose objects stored in S3(extremely rare)
- Availability: measures how readily an object can be retrieved
    - varies depending on the storage class
