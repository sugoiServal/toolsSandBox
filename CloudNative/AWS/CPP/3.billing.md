# AWS pricing model
- 4 pricing models
    - `Pay as you go`: pay for what you use, meet scale demands
    - `Save when you reserve`: minimize risks, predictably manage budget, comply with long-terms requirements. `Reserved`
        - EC2, DynomaDB, ElastiCache, RDS, Redshift
    - `using more discounts`: volume-based discounts
    - `AWS scale economy discounts`: discounts when AWS grow the infrasturcture


## Free services
Free services & free tier in AWS
 - IAM
 - VPC
 - `Consolidated Billing`
 - Free but pay for the resource that you create:
    - `Elastic Beanstalk`
    - `CloudFormation`
    - `Auto Scaling Groups`
 - Free Tier: https://aws.amazon.com/free/
    - EC2 t2.micro instance for a year
    - S3, EBS, ELB, AWS Data transfer

## EC2 Pricing
- pricing factors (`per second`):
    - Number of instances
    - Instance configuration (region, computataion capacity, os, softwawre..)
    - ELB running time and amount of data processed
    - CloudWatch monitoring frequency

- EC2 pricing plans:
    - On-Demand: come and staying in the resort whenever we like and pay the full price
    - Reserved: plan a ahead how long to stay, if the saying duration is long enough, we might get a good discount. 1-3 years commitment, up to 75% discount.
    - Saving Plan: we know how much we want to spend(pay certain amount for a period) and want to spend it all. Can stay in any type of room, flex size.
    - Spot Instances: hotel allows people the bid for any empty room at low price, if you fail the bid you will be kick out anytime
    - Dedicated host: book an entire server
    - Capacity Reservations: book room so I can have availability to the room at a period of time, I will be bill even though I don't check in

|option|workload|price|
|-|-|-|
|On-Demand| short term and un-interrupted workloads|Highest|
|Reserved|steady-state app, database...|Discount by reserve time, upfront payment|
|Saving Plan|steady-state app, database...|discount based on usage and upfront |
|Spot Instances|failure resilitent jobs, not database or critical job|cheapest|
|Dedicated Hosts/instance|specific request|same as On-Demand|
|Capacity Reservations|need 100% availability for a time|same as On-Demand|

## Lambda 
- pay per `API call`
- pay per `duration*computation resource`

## ECS(container) pricing
- pay for EC2 resources created for the ECS container

## Fargate(serverless container) pricing
- pay for resources (CPU, memory) for the container

## S3 pricing (EFS is similar): pay per use of storage volumn
- `Storage class`: S3 Standard, S3 Infrequent Access, S3 One-Zone IA, S3
Intelligent Tiering, S3 Glacier and S3 Glacier Deep Archive
- `Number and size of object`s: Price can be tiered
- `requests`
- `Data transfer`:
    - to other region
    - transfer out of S3 (`in data is free`)
    - `Transfer aceleration`

## EBS: provisioned storage volumn
- volumn types e (based on performance)
- volumn in GB, per month

- IOPS: 
  - General Purpose SSD: Included • Provisioned IOPS SSD: Provisionned amount in IOPS 
  - Magnetic: Number of requests • Snapshots: • Added data cost per GB per month 
  - Data transfer: • Outbound data transfer are tiered for volume discounts • Inbound is free

- Snapshots: Snapshots are `added cost in GB` per month.
- Data transfer: 
    - transfer out of EBS, tiered for discount (`in data is free`)

## RDS pricing
- Per hour billing
- Database: Engine, Size, Memory class
- Purchase type:
    - On-demand
    - `Reserved instances` (1 or 3 years) with required up-front
- Backup Storage:
    - no charge until 100% of total db storage for a region
- Number of `IO requests` per month
- `Deployment`: single AZ or `multiple AZs`
- data transfer: transfer out of DB (`in data is free`)

## CloudFront (CDN) pricing
- `region where contents are served`
- `data volumn being served` (data out of cloudFront)
- `#HTTP/HTTPs requests`
- `aggregated bill` for all edge location

## Networking Costs
- bill /GB data transfer for different network types

# Savings Plan
- Setup commitments on AWS: $ amount per hour for 1/3 years, and upfront payment
    - resource free to choose during the agreement 
    - not matter how much you use (less or more)
## EC2 Saving plan
- up to 72% saving
- limits:
    - EC2
    - a `families of instance` `in a region`
- options 
    - arbitrary AZ, size, os, tenancy(shared/dedicated host)
    - upfront payment

## Compute Saving plan: most flexible
- up to 66% saving
- options:
    - compute services: EV2, Fargate, Lambda
    - families of instance, regions
    - arbitrary AZ, size, os, tenancy(shared/dedicated host)
## Machine Learning Saving plan: SageMaker


# AWS Compute Optimizer: (ML reduce cost)
- `Reduce costs` by `recommending optimal AWS resources for your workloads` (over-provision/under-provision)
- Uses `Machine Learning` to analyze` your resources’ config` and `CloudWatch
metrics`
- Support:
     - EC2 instances 
     - EC2 Auto Scaling Groups 
     - EBS volumes 
     - Lambda functions


# Price provisioning
## Pricing Calculator
- `Estimate the cost` for your solution architecture
- `mock architecture setup` -> calculate
# Costs Reports:
## Billing Dashboard
- `visual overview` of `billing, service breakdown`
- overview of `free-tier and usage`
## Cost Allocation Tags report
- `cost allocation tags` : track your AWS costs by `tag filtering`
    - AWS generated tags (aws:createdBy)
    - user tags
- `report in excel` format

## Cost and Usage Reports
- most comprehensive set of AWS `cost and usage data` + `additional metadata (eg, AWS services, pricing, and reservations)`
    - all billing used by an account and its IAM users 
    - reason of bill, metadata, etc
    - in up to hourly granularity
- `report in excel` format
- integrated with analysis tool: `Athena, Redshift or QuickSight` 

## Cost Explorer
- `visual overview`, more `filtering options`, more powerful than Billing Dashboard
- `graunlarity` up to hourly, `visualized`
- `forcast` usage up to `12 months` from past data
- `Savings Plan` recommendat portal to lower the bill

## Cost Anomaly Detection
-  Continuously `monitor your cost and usage` using `ML` to `detect unusual spends (cost spike)`
- no need to setup anything
- send anomaly detection `report` with `root-cause analysis`, notified with `SNS`


# Budget alerts
## CloudWatch Billing Alarms
- `Billing Alarms` feature inside `CloudWatch billing data` 
- `simple alarm` not powerful as `Budgets`, no forecast function
## Budgets
- Powerful budget tool
- Set custom budgets that `alert` you when you `usage/forecast` exceed your `budgeted thresholds `
- support Budgets
    - 3 types of budgets: `Usage, Cost, Reservation`
    - Reserved Instance(RI) utilizaion
        -  EC2, ElastiCache, RDS, Redshift
- filter target service, view: many, Same options as AWS Cost Explorer!  
- `5 SNS notifications` per budget
- 2 budgets free, then cost


# AWS service Quotas
- some resources have `limits`(`quotas`): 
    - eg, max # Lambda function running concurrnetly 
- `service Quotas` monitors quotas and `notify` user when `quotas close to threshold`
    - Create CloudWatch Alarms 
- `Request a quota increase` from AWS Service Quotas
