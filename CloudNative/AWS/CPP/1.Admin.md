# AWS Artifact
A service to download compliance report and agreement in AWS

- Artifact Reports:  AWS security and `compliance documents`
    - AWS ISO certifications,
    - Payment Card Industry (PCI), and 
    - System and Organization Control (SOC) reports
- Artifact Agreements: review, accept, and track the status of `AWS agreements`
    - Business Associate Addendum (BAA) 
    - Health Insurance Portability

# Organizations
- manage multiple account: `Master(management) account` => `child accounts`
    - `Consolidated Billing `
    - `Pricing` benefits
    - Pooling of EC2 instances, optimal `usage saving`
    - `API to create account`
    - `Restrict account privileges` using `Service Control Policies (SCP)`
    - global service


- good practices:
    - Enable CloudTrail on all accounts, send logs to central S3 account
    - Send CloudWatch Logs to central account

- two strategies: Multi Account vs One Account Multi VPC

- multi account organization strategies: `Organizational Units` (OU) 
    - `OU` essentially `folder` to `host Account`, in order `to use SCP`

## Service Control Policies(SCP)
- `Whitelist or blacklist IAM actions` (`in child OU or Account`, not incl master)
    - apply to all `Users and Roles` in `OU or Account`
    - SCP does not affect `service-linked roles` (roles enable `other AWS services to integrate with AWS Organizations`)
    - SCP must have an explicit Allow (`does not allow anything ALLOW` by default)

- Use cases:
    -  `Restrict access to certain services` (for example: can’t use EMR)
    - Enforce `PCI compliance` by disabling services

## consolidated billing 
- benefits
    - `Combine the usage of all accounts` to have more `saving discount`
        - eg: `reserved instances sharing`
    - `one billing` for all accounts


# AWS Control Tower
