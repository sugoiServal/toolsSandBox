# General cloud
### Well Architected Framework

# Admin, management

### Organizations
- `manage multiple account`
    - saving
    - Consolidated Billing
- `Organizational Units` (OU): `folder` to `host Account`, in order `to use SCP`
- to `remove account` from Organization, the AWS account must be able to operate as a `standalone account`


### IAM Identity Center
- `One login` for all your AWS `accounts` in an `Organizations`
### Service Control Policies(SCP): 什么OU能用什么service (through IAM)
- `Whitelist or blacklist` `IAM actions`, 
- `Restrict OU access to certain services`

### Control Tower
- `multi account(+SCP)` setup/management/Monitor `hub`

### Resource `Groups`
- `tag managements` and `tag editor`, to group resources
- `resource groups`: a collection of resources that `share common tags`
## IAM
### (root vs user)
- root user =  `account owner` > most privileged user 
    - `Do not use the root` for tasks
- root privileges:
    -`Change account settings`
    - `Close your AWS account`
    - `Restore IAM` user permissions
    - Change or cancel `AWS Support plan`
    - `Register` in the `Reserved Instance Market place`
    - Sign up for `GovCloud`
    - enable `S3 MFA`
### IAM policy & group
- policy: config user/groups `permission to different services`: ALLOW/DENY (JSON format)
- group: user `inherit policy` of a group

### IAM Roles
- Roles:  `services' access to other service`
    - Role =  identity + permissions + credentials with TTLs(STS)
    - Eg: EC2, Lambda, CloudFormation

### SecurityToken Service (STS)
- underlineing `service behind IAM role`(run in the backend)
    - create `temporary(TTL)` `limited-privileges` credentials
- not limited to service roles:
    - `cross-account`, users in `external systems`..

### IAM `Credentials` Reports(account-level)
- all user `credentials status `report
### IAM `Access` Advisor(user-level)

## (Storage)
### EBS (elastic block Store) Volumn
- a `network drive(USB stick)` you can attach/detach to instances. An instance can have multiple EBS.
- locked to an `Availability Zone(AZ)`, use `snapshot` to `migrate`
- `a EBS` can only be mounted to a EC2 instance in `Cloud Practioner level`.
- must create a file system after attach to use

### EBS Snapshot
- used to restore contents to another EBS volumn
- used to migrate EBS across AZ/region
- `Snapshot archive`:  `archive tier snapshot` make the storage 75% cheaper, (24 to 72 hours retrieval)

### EC2 Instance Store
- inside an EC2 Instance, `Ephemeral`, `better IO performance` than EBS
- good for cache, buffer, temp files etc.

### EFS -  Elastic File System

    - `Flat hierarchy`
- misc
    - Max object size is `5TB`, separate upload for 5G
    - bucket name must be `globally unique` (all `region` and all `account`)

### S3 tiers

    -  `cross region` replication(`CRR`) vs `same region` replication(`SRR`)    
    - Must enable `Versioning+ proper IAM write/read permission` in source and destination bucket
### S3 security
- `block all public access`: set on account level，will block all public access
- `Bucket Policy`: a json that define access control (Allow/Deny, Set of API, target)
- `bucket access control list(ACL)`: `least common` (can be disabled)
- `object access control list(ACL)`: finer grain (can be disabled)
- `Encryption`: `encrypt S3 objects` using `KMS`, or encrypt file before entering AWS

    - mySQL, Postgres, MariaDB, Oracle, SQL Server
- DB snapshot: backup and restore DB
    - `Copy` snapshot (different `region`)
    - `Share` snapshot (other `accounts`)
- RDS deployment strategies:
    - RDS `read replica`: scale horizontally read-only instances, writing only done to main RDS => improves `read performance`, database `scalability`, `disaster recovery`
    - Multi-AZ(`failover`) == `availability`: `failover RDB in other AZ`, switch to `failover` when `main RDS` outrage/fail
    - `Multi-region`: read replica in multiple regions: better `globally read performance` + `failover(disaster recovery)`
 
### Aurora

        - On-premises: use a `Customer Gateway (CGW)`
        - AWS: use a `Virtual Private Gateway(VGW)`

- `Direct Connect (DX)`
    - physical connection to AWS, high cost, security and fast


### CLient VPN

        - Target Tracking Scaling: maintain average cpu of xx...
    - Scheduled Scaling: based on time (eg. 5pm friday)
    - ML prediction scaling: pattern recognition ML to predict demand
 
### (Global unit)

- CloudFront vs S3 cross region replication

|CloudFront|S3 Cross Region Replication|
|-|-|
|edge network|region based |
|cached survive TTL|no limited time, real-time access updates|
|usage: static contents|usage: dynamic contents|

### AWS Global Accelerator
