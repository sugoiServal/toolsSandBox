# Glabal application

- Glabal application:
    - Application that is deployed to `multiple geographies(regions/Edge location)`

- issue to consider:
    - Latency(eg. asia to US): deploy closer to user
    - Disater recovery: fail-over to another region
    - Attack protection: distributed infrastructure is harder to attack(all in once)

- global units:
    - region: `us-east-1`
    - available zones (AZ) : `us-east-1a, us-east-1b, us-east-1c`
    - Edge locations (points of presences): for CDN

## AWS Local Zones:
- Local zones is further granular available zones, eg: boston/ chicago
- to get more close to the user 
- A `VPC` topic
## AWS WaveLength zone
- deploy AWS services to `5G network edges`
- Ultra-low latency application through 5G network
- WaveLength zone: user traffic never leave the communication service providers'(CSP) network, and never reach AWS
    - WaveLength zone itself have high bandwidth connection to AWS regions

# Route 53: Global DNS
- managed `DNS service`: url to server IP
- usage
    - route users to the closest deployment (de-latency)
    - for disaster recovery strategies

## Routing Policies

|name|desc|has health check|
|-|-|-|
|simple routing policy|no DNS policy|no|
|weighted routing policy|based traffic percentage(kind of load balancing)|yes|
|fail-over routing policy|health check the `primary server` otherwise the `failover server`|yes|
|latency routing policy|to closest server, based on min(latency)|yes|
# CloudFront: Global CDN
- CloudFront
    - `caches common requests` contents/resources (de-latency) to AWS `edges`
    - `replicate caches` to AWS edge locations(216 globally) to increase regional performance
    - `DDoS protection`: integrated with `Shield`, AWS Web application Firewall (`WAF`)
- Origin of CloudFront:
    - S3 bucket , use `Origin Access Control(OAC)` to enhance `security`
    - Any HTTP backend(EC2, S3 static website...)

### CloudFront vs S3 Cross Region Replication

|CloudFront|S3 Cross Region Replication|
|-|-|
|global edge network|Replication must be set up for each region |
|files are cached for TTL|files updated in near real time, read only|
|usage: static contents that must be available everywhere|usage: dynamic contents that need to be available in selected regions|
# S3 Transfer Acceleration
- usageï¼š `accelerate cross-region upload and download to S3 speed`
- How: transfer file `to AWS edge location as proxy `-> AWS `edge location forward data to S3 bucket` in the terget region

# AWS Global Accelerator
- usage: improve `global application performance` using `AWS (internal) global network` 
- improved network: TCP, UDP
