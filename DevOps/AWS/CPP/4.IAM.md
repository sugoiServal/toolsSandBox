IAM: Identity and access management, global service

# Basic 
### root user
- root have all the access permission
- like any IAM user, root user also have an account ID. but the logging process of root user and IAM user are different
    - root user login with their email address and password
    - IAM user login with the account ID, user name and possword.


### users
- `users` are people within your organization
- `user can be grouped`
    - a user don't have to be inside any group
    - a user can belong to multiple groups
- groups can only contain users, `not nested groups`

## Access `policy` management
### permissions policies
- users or groups can be assigned `policies` (in presets or Json format), which config user's permission to different services


- user inside a group's `inherit` the policy of the group, A user belongs to `multiple groups inherit` all the policy (insection) from these groups
- `attached directly`: `policies` can also be chosen from a list of preset to attach directly to a user





### inline policy & syntax
- policies attached to user through JSON form are called `inline policies`

- Version: policy language version
- id: an unique identifier for the policy(optional)
- Statement: an array
    - Sid: an identifier for the statement(optional)
    - Effect: either `Allow` or `Deny`
    - Principal: account/user/role to which this policy applied to
    - Action: list of actions this policy allow/deny
    - Resources: list of resources to which the `Action` applied to
    - Condition: condition when this policy is in effect(optional)


## IAM Roles
- sometimes certain `services need to access other service`, they will need permission to a AWS services with an `IAM role`

> An IAM role is an `identity you can create that has specific permissions` with credentials that are `valid for short durations`. Roles can be assumed by entities that you trust.

- common roles:
    - AWS services
        - EC2 instance roles
        - Lambda Function Roles
        - CloudFormation Roles
    - Other: out of scope

- How: create role -> assign access policy

## IAM Security Tools
IAM provides 2 security tools
### IAM Credentials Reports(account-level)
- a report that lists `all your accounts users` and the status of their various credentials
- Where: IAM-> Crediential Report
### IAM Access Advisor(user-level)
- shows the `service permissions granted to a user` And when those service were `last accessed`
- May help admin cut down unnecessary service access permission to a user
- Where: IAM-> Users -> `<any user>` -> Access Advisor

## SecurityToken Service (STS)
- underlineing `service behind IAM role`(run in the backend)
- create `temporary(TTL)`, `limited-privileges` credentials that enables someone/services to access your resources
- use cases:
    - Identity federation: manage user identities in external systems, give them access to AWS resources
    - IAM Roles for cross/same account access
    - IAM Roles for services

# Auth Policy
## password policies
    - minimal length, 
    - character types, 
    - password expiration, 
    - prevent password reuse

## MFA: multi factor authentication
    - MFA =  password + security physical devices
    - options: 
        - virtual MFA device(phone apps): google authenticator, Authy, Lastpass authenticator, Google authenticator
        - universal 2nd Factor(U2F) Key(physical device): YubiKey
        - Hardware key Fob MFA device: Gemalto
        - Hardware key Fob MFA devic for AWS GovCloud: SurePassID
    - where: Security credentials-> Multi-factor authentication (MFA)
## Access key
- there are other interfaces to access AWS, some of them require using `access key`
> use access keys to make secure `REST or HTTP` protocol requests to a AWS service APIs

|||
|-|-|
|AWS management console(web)|password + MFA|
|AWS CLI|Direct access to services, protected by access key|
|AWS software developer kit|For coding APIs(embedded in application), protected by access key|

### generate access key
- where: IAM-> users-> create access key 
 


# Summary
## IAM best practices
- `do not` use `root account` except for setting up a first account. `Use` `admin IAM user` for every day and administration tasks
- One AWS user = One physical user
- manage user permission `policies` by `assigned user to groups`
- create `roles` when giving permission to AWS service
- create strong password policies and use `multi factor authentication(MFA)`
- generate and use `access keys` for `cli or sdk`
- security summary with `IAM credential reports`
- `never` share IAM users or access keys
- `Never` login IAM with credientials in any EC2 Instances, instead, attach IAM role to EC2 Instance
## Shared Responsibility Model for IAM
- rule: AWS for infrastruct, user for using the infrastructure
- IAM Shared Responsibility Model example

|AWS|user|
|-|-|
|Infrastructure security|create users, roles, groups, policies and mamage/monitor them|
|Compliance vaildation|enable MFA on all accounts|
|service configration, vulnerability analysis|rotate user keys often|
||audit wuth IAM tools to apply permission appropriately|
||analyze access patterns and review permissions|


# AWS IAM Identity Center
One login `(single sign-on)` for `all your AWS accounts` in AWS `Organizations`
- remember one credential to login all accounts you have
