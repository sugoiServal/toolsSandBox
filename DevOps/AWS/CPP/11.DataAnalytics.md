# Redshift
`BI, data analytic and data warehousing` tool
- Used for OLAP - (Online Analytical Processing )(`data analytic and data warehousing`)
- based on `PostgreSQL`, good at data analytic computation

- Not row based! `Columnar storage` of data
- Scale to `PBs of data`

- `Massively Parallel Query Execution (MPP)`, high availability
- Has a `SQL interface` for query
- Integrated `business intelligence (BI) tools`: AWS Quicksight/ Tableau


# Amazon EMR - Elastic MapReduce
- EMR helps creating `Hadoop clusters` (Big Data) to analyze vast amount of data
- `Hadoop` is an open source technology to `allow multiple servers on a clusters to analyze a source of data`
- Hadoop ecosystem:
    - Apache `Spark`, HBase, Presto, Flink
- `managed service`: EMR takes care of all the `provisioning and configurations`
- Use case: big data processing/machine learning, web indexing

# Amazon Athena
- Analyze against `S3 data objects`, using `serverless` server, `use SQL` language to query the files
- Use cases: business intelligence (BI)/ analytics, analyze VPC flow logs/ ELB logs/ CloudTrail trails, etc

# Amazon QuickSight
- `serverless`, 
- `machine learning powered`, 
- `business intelligence (BI) tool` to create interactive `dashboards`

- `Integrated with most BI services and DB`:
    - RDS, Aurora
    - Athena
    - Redshift, 
    - S3
- use case:
    - Business analytics
    - Data visualization 
    - ad-hoc analysis

# Amazon Glue
- a managed `ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)` process service
- ETL: 
>The source systems can include a variety of databases, such as transactional databases, operational databases, and other external data sources. The ETL process involves `extracting` the relevant data from these sources, `transforming` it into a format that can be easily used in analysis, and `loading` it into the data warehouse.

- Fully serverless service

- AWS Glue Data Catalog
    - `a central repository` to store structural and operational `metadata` for data assets in AWS Glue (table definition, physical location, business relevant attributes, track how this data has changed over time)
