
# command logic flow (short-circuiting operators)
- execute multiple command consecutely (;  &&   ||)
- everything from left to right
``` bash
cmd1; cmd2  # cmd1 then cmd2, ';' equal to line change
cmd1 && cmd2  
  # execute cmd2 only when cmd1 success
    # cmd1 $? = 0, exec cmd2
    # cmd1 $? != 0, won't exec cmd2
cmd1 || cmd2  
  # only one command will be executed
    # cmd1 $? = 0, won't exec cmd2
    # cmd1 $? != 0, exec cmd2

# example:
ls /tmp/aa || madir /tmp/aa && touch /tmp/aa/newFile    
# Check if a directory exists if not create that directory and then create a new file
```

# data redirect
- redirect types
  - stdin (<): code 0
  - stdout (>): code 1
  - stderr (2>): code 2
  - direct stdout and stderr to same place: (2>&1) 
- redirect signs (</>/2>) **alway putted at the right of command/application**

- **/dev/null** blackhole, will consume everything being directed to it
``` bash
echo hello > hello.txt          # stdout of echo redir to hello.txt
cat >> hello.txt                # keyboard input will be append to hello.txt, ctrl+D quit

cat < hello.txt > hello2.txt    # redir stdin of cat from hello.txt, then redir stdout of cat to hello2.txt
(cat < hello.txt) > hello2.txt  # same as the previous

cat noExistFile.txt 2> /dev/null    # redirect error message to /dev/null

# redirect stdout&stderr to same file/ different file
echo "hello" > out.txt 2>&1
echo "hello" > out.txt 1> stdout.txt 2> stderr.txt
```
- (>, 2>) single redirect sign means **overwrite**; (>>, 2>>) double redirect sign means **append mode**

|Redirect Sign| Mode|
|---|---|
|>|stdout, overwrite content of a file (if exist)|
|>>|stdout, append to content of a file (if exist)|
|2>|stderr, overwrite content of a file (if exist)|
|2>>|stderr, append to content of a file (if exist)|

# pipe
- what 'app1 | app2' do is chaining app1 and app2  by **making the output of app1 the input of app2**
- difference between '>' and '|'
  - stdout (>) is used to redirect output of a program to **a file**
  - pipe | is used to redirect output of a program to **another program**
- 管道的对象必须是一个命令！ 并且这个命令能够接受stdin的输入。输入管道的必须是stdout的数据，不能是stderr。
``` bash
ls -l / | tail -n1  # cut the last line of ls

# is equal to following commands
ls -l / > 'curDir.txt'    # redir stdout of ls to a file
tail -n1 'curDir.txt'     # use the file as tail's input argument

```
- the example above shows that 'tail' have two kinds of input:
  - data stream, coming from ls through pipe (line 1)
  - argument, as single file name 'curDir.txt' (line 5)
## 1). data stream pipe
- common pipe usage: string process
``` bash
# cut -d: Cut out fields (of each line) from stdin or files. through separator (-d)
... | cut -d
# grep: search and return substring, through RegularExpression
... | grep
# sort: sort by start of line
cat /etc/passwd | sort
# wc: count number of word
cat /etc/passwd | wc
# uniq -c: omit repeat data and count repetition
last | cut -d ' ' -f1 | sort | uniq -c
```
## 2). argument pipe: xargs
- xarg read stdin, by default use ' ' to separate arguments, and send stdin as arguments to target program
``` bash
xargs
  #  -0, --null
          # Input items are terminated by a null character instead of by whitespace
  #  --delimiter=delim
          # Input items are terminated by the specified character.
  # -a file
          # Read items from file instead of standard input.

cmd1 | xargs cmd2 # Run cmd2 using the output data of cmd1 as arguments
find . -name '*.backup' -print0 | xargs -0 rm -v   #  Delete all files with a .backup extension (-print0 uses a null character to split file names, and -0 uses it as delimiter):
```

## 3). use stdin/stdout in command argument: -
- for command that output as a file, we can use '-' in the position of the file, means a stdout datastream
- for command that input from a file, we can use '-' in the position of the file, means a stdin datastream

```bash
tar -cvf - /home | tar -xvf - -C /tmp/homebk
# in the example home is compressed, The compressed data instead of being written to a file, is rewired to the stdout '-'. then being pipe to another tar's stdin '-', where the data is decompressed. 
```
## 4). stdin copy: tee
- tee is a program that take stdin as input, and **make two copy of the data**, one sent to stdout and the other send to a file or program

``` bash
echo 'aa' |tee 'aa.txt'     # 'aa' being writen to 'aa.txt'(overwrite), also printed in screen
echo 'aa' |tee 'aa.txt' -a  # 'aa' being appended instead of overwriting

echo "example" | tee 'aa.txt' -a | xargs printf "[%s]"  # 'aa' was sent to 'aa.txt', and the stdout containing 'aa' was again piped as an argument to printf
```
###  permission issue:
- Operations like |, >, and < are done by the shell, the shell need system authentication to pipe or redirect data to system file/program
``` bash
sudo echo '3' > sysFile   
# command like this won't work, as echo run as super user, '>' does not have permission
echo '3' | sudo tee sysFile 
# however, tee running as super user can write the stdin into a system file

```

# native wildcard: shell globbing
|||
|--|--|
|?|one character|
|*|any amount of characters|
|{}|a set of substring|

``` bash
rm foo*

convert image.{png,jpg}
cp /path/to/project/{foo,bar,baz}.sh /newpath
mv ./*{.py,.sh} ./Scripts   # move all py, sh scripts to folder Script
```
