# The ways to use React in App
> [Reactjs docs](https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html#create-react-app)
- for add React Components to existing Pages, use [CDN](https://reactjs.org/docs/add-react-to-a-website.html#add-react-in-one-minute) (content deliverying network) 
- for small project, thorugh npx create-react-app (single page application SPA)
- for server‑rendered application next.js

## the Babel lib
- Babel is a JavaScript compiler that compile JSX (before React app send to browser)
- Babel is a toolchain that is mainly used to convert ECMAScript 2015+ code into a backwards compatible version of JavaScript in current and older browsers or environments
- through [CDN: In the browser tag](https://babeljs.io/setup#installation)

## create-react-app
- npx is part of node, it temporally download a scirpt and run it
```bash
npx create-react-app my-app     # temporally download and run script "create-react-app"
cd my-app
npm start
```
# terms and ideas
- Rendering logic is UI logic:
    - UI logic: the user experience, how user action change the state of environment, and thus change the UI
        - how events are handled, 
        - how the state changes over time,
        - how the data is prepared for display
    - And the rendering of HTML should follow the logic

# React Elements
- what is Element
  - An React element object is a lightweight description of what to render
  - Elements can have internal logic through Javascript, the determine the rendered output through user interaction
  - Elements support OOP abstraction 
  - Elements are also capable to create other Elements
- Naming: elements' name should always start with capital letter
```js
// create element is
<Welcome />
// if not captialize, its easy to be mistaken as HTML tag
<div /> 
```
## components
- components is a concept: ANYTHING that RETURNS ELEMENTS is component 
### JSX is the simplest element
- JSX: a syntax extension to JavaScript
    - JSX embedded HTML in JS
    - JSX produces React “elements”.
- JSX are also building blocks to other components 
- passing elements in JSX
    - **JS expressions are surrounded with {}**
    - **HTML attributes are strings ""**
```js
// embed variable
const name = 'Josh Perez';
const element = <h1>Hello, {name}</h1>;
// embed function call
function formatName(user) {...}
const element = (<h1>Hello, {formatName(user)}!</h1>);
```
- JSX is also used in return and logic flows(if-else, iterations)
```js
function getGreeting(user) {
  if (user) {
    return <h1>Hello, {formatName(user)}!</h1>;
  }
  return <h1>Hello, Stranger.</h1>;
}
```
- Babel compiles JSX down to React.createElement() calls.
```js
const Element = (<h1 className="greeting">Hello, world!</h1>);
// is complied implicitly, equivalent to this code 
const Element = React.createElement('h1',{className: 'greeting'},'Hello, world!');
// the React element is like
const Element = {
  type: 'h1',
  props: {
    className: 'greeting',
    children: 'Hello, world!'
  }
};
```
### function components
- element is returned with "return"
```js
// a function that return element
function Welcome(props) {
  return <h1>Hello, {props.name}</h1>;
}
```
### Class components
- element is returned with method "render", each class component need to call method render
- when "root.render(\<Component />);", the render() method will be called and root.render will recursively find all componented returned by the render() mehtod and call their render method 
- render() method tell React what should be displayed in the root div
```js
class Welcome extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
        ...
    }
  }
  render() {
    return <h1>Hello, {this.props.name}</h1>;
  }
}
```
**Child and Parent**
- in React, component create(instantiated) within another component is call a child
- This is an "owned by" relationship
```js
class Game extends React.Component {        // parent
    ...
    render(
        ...
        return (
            ...
            <div>
                <Board                          // children
                    Prop1={"A"}
                    Prop2={"B"}
                />
                <Clock />
                <Clock />
                <Clock />
            <div>

       )
    )
}
```
## component utility methods
### componentDidMount, componentWillUnmount
- lifecycle method
- Mounting: when a component is rendered (ie inserted into DOM tree), it is mounted
- lifecycle method define actions whenever/after this. component got rendered and got removed

|method|desc |
|-|- |
|this.componentDidMount()|componentDidMount() is invoked immediately after a component is mounted (inserted into the tree). This method is a good place to set up any subscriptions. If you do that, don’t forget to unsubscribe in componentWillUnmount().|
|this.componentWillUnmount()|componentWillUnmount() is invoked immediately before a component is unmounted and destroyed. Perform any necessary cleanup in this method, such as invalidating timers, canceling network requests, or cleaning up any subscriptions that were created in componentDidMount().  Should not call setState() in componentWillUnmount() because the component will never be re-rendered. |


- Resource freeup
  - In applications with many components, it’s very important to free up resources taken by the components when they are destroyed.
  - componentWillUnmount act like a deconstructor to destory resources

### forceUpdate()
- this method force component to re-render itself
  
|method|desc |
|-|- |
|this.forceUpdate()|By default, when your component’s state or props change, your component will re-render. If your render() method depends on some other data, you can tell React that the component needs re-rendering by calling forceUpdate().|
# Props and state
> "React components automatically re-render whenever there is a change in their state or props"
> 
- data in elements are managed by two containers, props and state
  - props is data being passed into elements when element is created, as function parameters or construtor function parameter
  - state is represents elements internal states, as a property of class
- data can be any objects: containers, functions
## props
- props is used to pass data from parent components to child components
- function element and class elements are created with same syntax, specifying element name and pass prop as objects
- props must be read-only
  - neither function or class components can attempt to alter the props passed to it 
```js
// pass various data types as props
<Component string="string prop" boolean={true} object={key: "value"} fun={()=>{callbackFun(i)}}>
```

### passing function as prop

- passing function to children usually when the child component need to manipulate the state of its parent
``` js
<Square value={this.props.squares[i]} 
      onClick={()=>this.props.onClick(i)}
    />
```

### children prop
- we can pass template JSX(HTML) to component as **children prop**, which allows better customization in component and better infomation flow
```js
// in app.js (parent component)
  // the JSX between Modal tag are wrap in props.children in each Modal component
return (
  <Modal>
    <p>Use the code BUY2022 at the checkout.</p>
  </Modal>
  
  <Modal>
    <h2>10% Off Coupon Code!!</h2>
  </Modal>)
```
```js
// in Modal
export default function Modal(props) {
  return (
      <div className="modal">
        {props.children}      // access children props
      </div>
    )
}
```


## state
- State is private properties of component and is fully controlled by the component: (encapsulated), it is not accessible to any component other than the one that owns and sets it.
- if state of component required, use class components. if there's no need to use state just use function component.
  
**Declare State**
- state is declared in class constructor
- it is possible to set initial values in state
```js
class Welcome extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      history: [{squares: Array(9).fill(null),}],
      xIsNext: true,
      stepNumber: 0,
    }
  }
 render() {...}
```
**Access State**
```js
this.state.myField
```
**Change State**
- to change the state, use setState() method (and only use that)
- it is beneficial to ensure that state's data is immutable: each time we need to modify the state of element, we pass a modified data to state instead modify the data in state inplace(aka use same reference)
```js
this.setState({
    history : history.slice().concat([{squares:squares,}]),   // slice() creates a shallow copy, since "history" contain no reference, it is fine to use slice
    xIsNext:!this.state.xIsNext,
    stepNumber:this.state.stepNumber+1,
});

// setState also accept function as a mean to update state 
this.setState((state, props) => ({     // use props to update state.counter
  counter: state.counter + props.increment
}));
```
> [State Updates May Be Asynchronous](https://reactjs.org/docs/state-and-lifecycle.html#state-updates-may-be-asynchronous)
- React may batch multiple setState() calls into a single update for performance.
- for example, merging change to several fields, and render them all in once

**Communicate with child**
- although state is private, components can pass state as props to its child
```js
<FormattedDate date={this.state.date} />
```
- This is commonly called a “top-down” or “unidirectional” data flow.


# Define logics in Component
## Handling Events
Handling events with React elements is very similar to handling events on DOM elements. There are some syntax differences:

- React events are named using camelCase, rather than lowercase.
- With JSX you pass a function as the event handler, rather than a string.
- EXPLICITLY call preventDefault to prevent default behavior
- When using React, you generally don’t need to call addEventListener to add listeners to a DOM element after it is created. Instead, just provide a listener when the element is initially rendered.
```js
// Click listener
<button onClick={activateLasers}>  // activateLasers is function
  Activate Lasers
</button>

// prevent default
function handleSubmit(e) {
    e.preventDefault();
    console.log('You clicked submit.');
  }

<form onSubmit={handleSubmit}></form>
```
> a common pattern (to handle event) is to make an event handler to be a method on the class. 
```js
class Toggle extends React.Component {
    // ...   
    handleClick() {...}
    defineSomeElements() {...}
    render() {
        const elements =  defineSomeElements();
        return (
            <div>
                <ul>{elements}</ul>
                <button onClick={() => this.handleClick()}>
                <myChild/>
            </div>
        )
    }
}
```
- better ways to define handleClick() are use function expressions OR explicitly bind this to handleClick
  - this prevent page being re-rendered when handleClick is passed as props to child element

```js
// use function expressions
class Toggle extends React.Component {
    const handleClick = () => {...};
    render() {
        ...
        return (
            ...
                <button onClick={this.handleClick}>
    )}
}
```

```js
// explicitly bind this
this.handleClick = this.handleClick.bind(this);
```

## Create List of elements
- use map to create list of elements as \<li>
```js
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
const listItems = numbers.map((number) =>
 <li key={number.toString()}>{number}</li>
);
return (<ul>{listItems}</ul>);
// alternative syntax, warp map inside JSX
return (
    <ul>
      {numbers.map((number) =>
        <li key={number.toString()}>{number}</li>
      )}
    </ul>
)
```
### **Key**
- A “key” is a unique string attribute you need to include when creating lists of elements. 
  -  Keys used within arrays should be unique among their siblings. However, they don’t need to be globally unique.
- Keys help React identify which items have changed, are added, or are removed.
- Most often you would use **IDs from your database** as keys
- it is not recommend using indexes for keys since the order of items may change

```js
// example: pass key to List Element
function ListItem(props) {
  return <li>{props.value}</li>;
}

function NumberList(props) {
  const numbers = props.numbers;
  const listItems = numbers.map((number) =>
    <ListItem key={number.toString()} value={number} />
  );
  return ( <ul>{listItems}</ul> );
}
```


# Rendering Elements
##  root node
- root node is a div with id="root" inside the HTML page where you want to manage its behavior with React 
  - everything inside root node will be managed by React DOM.
```js
<div id="root"></div>
```
- Applications built with just React usually have a single root DOM node. If you are integrating React into an existing app, you may have as many isolated root DOM nodes as you like.
  - for example, a page with many independent parts (UI + functions) that need to be managed by React separately
- On the other hand pages' behavior does not need to be managed solely with React, React can be supplementary to ordinary DOM manipulation
## render element with root node
```js
// define elements above
...
// get root div and create root with it
const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(
  document.getElementById('root')
);
// use root to render React element
root.render(myElement)
```
- most React apps only call root.render() once. 
  - the element passed to it can has its own states and behavior to reflect the UI logic
  - However, it is possible that root.render() be call multiple times

### what is being rendered?
- after root.render(myElement)
  - if it is a function (stateless) component, the element's return is rendered
  - if it is a class component, the element's render() method is called, and the method's return is rendered
    - we can further refine the render's UI logic in render() before pass it to the return 

## Conditional Rendering
- what is it?
  - In React, you can create distinct components that encapsulate behavior you need. Then, you can render only some of them, depending on the state of your application.

- first way: wrap in a component and pass the logic by props
```js
function Greeting(props) {
  const isLoggedIn = props.isLoggedIn;
  if (isLoggedIn) {
    return <h1>Welcome back!</h1>;
  }
  return <h1>Please sign up.</h1>;
}
root.render(<Greeting isLoggedIn={false} />);
```
- short inline logic: &&
```js
function Mailbox(props) {
  const unreadMessages = props.unreadMessages;
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Hello!</h1>
      {unreadMessages.length > 0 &&     // && act like bash command &&
        <h2>
          You have {unreadMessages.length} unread messages.
        </h2>
      }
    </div>
  );
}
```
- use conditional operator:
  -  condition ? true : false.
```js
render() {
  const isLoggedIn = this.state.isLoggedIn;
  return (
    <div>
      {isLoggedIn
        ? <LogoutButton onClick={this.handleLogoutClick} />
        : <LoginButton onClick={this.handleLoginClick} />
      }
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Prevent Rendering
- to forceful hide a render element, return null in the element
```js
function WarningBanner(props) {
  if (!props.warn) {    // the props determine whether warningBanner is shown
    return null;
  }
  return (
    <div className="warning">
      Warning!
    </div>
  );
}

render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <WarningBanner warn={this.state.showWarning} />  // something defines the showWarning state
      </div>
    )}
```

# misc
## Fragments
- A common pattern in React is for a component to return multiple HTML elements wrapped by single \<div>. 
```js
   return (
      <div>
         <h1 className="title">{props.title}</h1>
      </div>
   )
```
- sometime the \<div> is unwanted, we can use fragment shorthand to avoid unwanted div node
```js
   return (
      <>
         <h1 className="title">{props.title}</h1>
      </>
   )
```
- when it needs to pass some properties to the component, shorthand cannot be used, We should manually create the fragment

```js
events.map((event, index) => (
  <React.Fragment key={evemt.id}>
    <h2>{index} - {event.title} <h2>
  <React.Fragment>
))
```

## portal
- Portals provide a way to render children into a DOM node that exists outside the hierarchy of the DOM component. (that is, typically, the root node)
```js
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom'
// syntax: createPortal(child, container)

// example: this child component will be render at the level of HTML <body>
export default function Title(props) {
   return ReactDOM.createPortal((
      <div>
         <h1 className="title">{props.title}</h1>
         <br />
         <h2 className="subtitle">{props.subtitle}</h2>
      </div>
   ), document.body )
}
```
