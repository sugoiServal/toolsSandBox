# Context provider
- Contact provider gives some level of random access to certain information through out React DOM tree, without Prop Drilling
> Prop Drilling: in order to pass some information from highstream parent component to a downstreamcomponent you have to pass it all the way through the DOM tree
- contest provider is implemented as follow: the provTree wrapped any contents in the React Component tree, And provide "context information" for any children inside the wrapper

## wrapping
```js
// in ThemeContext.js
import { createContext } from "react";
export const ThemeContext = createContext()
export function ThemeProvider({children}) {
    // component ThemeProvider can be used to provide addition logic to the value inside ThemeContext
    return (
        <ThemeContext.Provider value={{color:'blue'}}>
            {children}
        </ThemeContext.Provider>
    )
}

// in the React Components that you want to warp with context (eg <App/>)
<ThemeProvider>
    <App />
</ThemeProvider>
```
## access
```js
// in any component wrapped as decendent of the wrapper
import { useContext } from "react"
const { color } = useContext(ThemeContext)
```
> if "useContext(ThemeContext)" is assessed from outside the wrapper. it's going to return "undefined"
