# What is it
- reducer is a tool to manage and update State, just as setters in useState() hook. 
- reducer provides more powerful ways to manage complex states, especially for reference types

> simply put a fancier useState
```js
import { useReducer } from "react";

// [state_variable, dispatch] = useReducer(function_to_switch_logic, initialize_state_value)
    // dispatch is basically setter function
const [themeState, dispatch] = useReducer(themeReducer, { color: "blue"})

//! ==> we have "themeState" to use as state, which is init as { color: "blue"}
//! ==> we have setup router "themeReducer", which can be fired and communicated through function "dispatch"

// themeReducer: function_to_switch_logic
    // input:themeState, the state_variable
    // input:action, the object passed by dispatch -- type and payload
const themeReducer = (themeState, action) => {
    switch (action.type) {
        case 'CHANGE_COLOR':
            // keep other state unchanged, and change color
            return {...themeState, color: action.payload}
        default: // default keep unchanged
            return state
    }
}

// dispatch: the state setter
    // type: the route, as defined in themeReducer
    // payload: data pass to the themeReducer
// call dispatch trigger the themeReducer function!!
dispatch({type: 'CHANGE_COLOR', payload: color})
```
