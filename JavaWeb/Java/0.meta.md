### Java ecosystem
The Java ecosystem is a collection of tools, frameworks, and libraries:

|||
|-|-|
|The Java Development Kit (JDK)|a set of tools and libraries that are used to develop Java applications.|
|JVM|an abstract computing machine that enables a computer to run **Java bytecode**. `platform-independent` and support multiple languages: **Groovy, Scala, Kotlin**|
|Java SE (Standard Edition) and Java EE (Enterprise Edition)|Java SE standard dist. Java EE is built-upon Java SE for enterprise-level applications. |
|Java frameworks|`Spring`, Struts, and `Hibernate`. |
|Build tools |such as `Maven` and Gradle|
|Java IDEs like Eclipse, **IntelliJ IDEA**|Integrated Development Environments|

### JVM
- **JVM** stands for Java Virtual Machine, 
- JVM responsible for `runs Java bytecode`, which is `a program that has been compiled from Java source code`
- JVM is designed to be platform-independent
- JVM provides built-in memory management and automatic `garbage collection`

### java files
- `package`: packages are essentially `folder`, contains either packages or .java file.
- .java: source codes: classes, mehtods, main...
- files after compile
    - `.class`: compiled .java
    - `.jars`: .class will be package into `jars` after the compilation and linkage
- package->modules->library->->application: application may contain several libraries, core module which made from multiple packages


### Use `Jshell` (Read-Eval-Print Loop (REPL))to learn the syntax
```bash
\<tab> #completion
/vars #variable list
```
