# Overview
- less than 1 or 2 questions at your exam. 
- At the AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner Level, you should know about:
    - VPC, Subnets, Internet Gateways & NAT Gateways
    - Security Groups, Network ACL (NACL), VPC Flow Logs
    - VPC Peering, VPC Endpoints
    - Site to Site VPN & Direct Connect


# IP
## IPv4
- public IPv4: 
    -   `default`: EC2 instance gets a new a public IP address every time you stop then start it
    - `Elastic IP` â€“ allows you to attach a fixed public IPv4 address to EC2 instance

- Private IPv4: used on private networks (LAN) such as internal AWS
networking
    - `Private` IPv4 is `fixed for EC2 Instances` in its lifecycle

## IPv6
- Every IPv6 address is `public` (no private range)

# VPC (Virtual private cloud)
- a private network to deploy your resources
    - a `default VPC` is created automatically for your account
    - Your EC2 instances will be launched `inside a subnet` in the `default VPC`
- component of VPC


- features:
    - VPC feature is limit to region

|name|desc|resource level|
|-|-|-|
|VPC|a private networ. a VPC can have multiple subnets|Region level|
|Subnets|allows to partition your network inside of a VPC. a subnet can include `private or public components`, (`whether or not accessible from the Internet`)|AZ level|
|`Route Tables`|define how to access to the Internet and between subnest from any instances||
|`Internet Gateway`|manage/control `traffic in and out of the VPC`, connecting to Internet Gateway makes a `subnet public`||
|`NAT Gateway`|allow `private subnet` `access to Internet` while `remaining private`. This is achieved by using public subnet as proxy|

## Subnets
### Public subnet
- subnet in a VPC that is accessible from Internet
    - eg: loadbalancer, server
### Private subnet
- subnet in a VPC that is NOT accessible from Internet
    - eg: database    


# Network security

## Network ACL (NACL)
- `subnet level` security control

## Security Groups
- `instance level (EC2)` security control

|spec|Network ACL (NACL)|Security Groups|
|-|-|-|
|level|`subnet level`|`EC2 instance`|
|rule types|ALLOW/ DENY|only ALLOW|
|rule target|only IP|IP, security groups|
|statefulness|stateless: return traffic must be explicitly allowed|stateful: return traffic is automatically allowed|


# VPC Flow Logs
-  IP traffic logging system for debug/troubleshooting
    - `VPC` Flow Logs
    - `Subnet` Flow Logs
    - `Elastic Network` Interface Flow Logs
    - Captures network information from AWS managed interfaces too: Elastic Load Balancers, ElastiCache, RDS, Aurora
- Helps to monitor & troubleshoot connectivity issues

- VPC Flow logs `data can go to S3 / CloudWatch Logs`

# VPC peering
- `Connect two VPC`, make them looked as if one network
    - two vpc must `not have overlapping CIDR (ip range)`
    - `not transitive`, a = b, b = c, not led to a = c


# VPC Endpoint
- VPC -> AWS network -> AWS service:
    - VPC Endpoint `Gateway`: S3, DynamoDB
    - VPC Endpoint `Interface`: other  
- allow `services inside a VPC` to connect to `AWS services(AWS data center)` through `AWS private network`, `instead of public Internet`
    - why: 
        - Security
        - lower latency
- Two types of Endpoints:
    - VPC Endpoint `Gateway`: `S3 & DynamoDB`
    - VPC Endpoint `Interface` (Elastic Network Interface, ENI): rest services

# AWS PrivateLink(VPC Endpoint Services)
- To `expose a service within a VPC` (in an account) to `1000 of VPCs`(eg customer) in many other accounts
- Requirement:
    - service end: NLB - Network Load Balance
    - User end: ENI - Elastic Network Interface

# Hybrid VPC
- goal: connect `on premise private network` to a `VPC` in the cloud
## Site to Site VPN
- properties: 
    - `Encrypted` traffic goes over `public Internet`
    - `fast setup`
- Setup:
    - On-premises: use a `Customer Gateway (CGW)`
    - AWS: use a `Virtual Private Gateway(VGW)`
![](https://imgur.com/wsLmgwD.jpg)
## Direct Connect (DX)
- properties: 
    - Establish a` physical connection` between on-premises and AWS
    - `slow setup`: Takes at least a month to establish, `expensive`
    - `Secure and fast`

# CLient VPN
- connect `any client device` to a `VPC in cloud` `securely`
    - eg. connect to private EC2 instance through its private IP (public IP not exposed)

- connect through the `Internet`
- A client connect to VPC through `CLient VPN`, if the VPC is connected to a `on-premise private network` through `Site to Site VPN`, the client can also connect to it on-premise private network!!!!

# Transit Gateway
- tool to `Connect` `1000 of VPC` and `on-premises networks` together
    - in a `hub and star` fashion
    - traffic through either `VPN(encrypted Internet)` or `direct connect(DX)`
