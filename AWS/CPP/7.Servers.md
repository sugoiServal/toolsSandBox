# EC2: Elastic compute cloud 
- it is a IaaS
- capability of: 
    - renting virtual machines(EC2)
    - storing data on virtual drive(EBS volumn)
    - load balancer, distributing load across machine(ELB)
    - scaling the service using an auto-scaling group (ASG)

## EC2 Config Options, Overview
- `OS`: Linux, Win, Mac OS
- `CPU`
- `RAM`
- `Storage` space
    - Network-attached storage(EBS & EFS)
    - hardware storage(EC2 Instance Store)
- `Network` card: Speed of network, Public IP address, Private IP address(for AWS VPC communication)
- `Firewall` rules
- `Bootstrap sudo scrip` to configure first launch(EC2 User data script)
    - Updates
    - Install soft, frameworks, etc
    - download resource from internets
    - etc

## EC2 Instance 
- [lecture](https://www.udemy.com/course/aws-certified-cloud-practitioner-new/learn/lecture/20055646#overview)

### Launch Instance
> EC2 -> Instances -> launch Instances
- use key pair to login:
> Key pair (login)-> Create new key pair -> `use .pem` except for win7/8
- user data script
    - Specify user data to provide commands or a command script to run when you launch your instance.

> Advanced details -> user data

### Instance Control
- Stop/ Start Instance (state is kept)
    - `atfer restarted, the public IP and Public IPv4 DNS may be changed!!!`
- Reboot instance
- Delete Instance(Terminate)

### Instance Types [ref](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types)
- ec2 instance infos: [live](https://instances.vantage.sh/)
- Instance naming convention: m5.2xlarge
    - m: instance class
    - 5: generation (AWS improves instances over time)
    - 2xlarge: size of the instance

|type|class|feature|eg|
|-|-|-|-|
|General Purpose|T or M|provide a `balance of compute, memory and networking resources`, and can be used for a variety of diverse workloads| `web servers, code repositories`.|
|Compute Optimized|C|ideal for compute bound applications that benefit from `high performance processors`:|batch processing workloads, media transcoding, high performance web servers, high performance computing (HPC), scientific modeling, dedicated gaming servers and ad server engines, machine learning inference|
|Memory Optimized|R or X|deliver fast performance for workloads that process large data sets in memory.|high performance database, Distributed web scale cache store, In-memory db optimized for BI(business intelligence), applications performing real time processing of big unstructured data|
|Storage Optimized|I or D or H1|for workloads that require high, sequential read and write access to very large data sets on local storage. |high frequency online transaction processing system(OLTP), Databases, Cache for in-memory databse , data warehousing applications, Distributed file systems|
|Accelerated Computing||Accelerated computing instances use hardware accelerators, or co-processors, to perform functions, |such as floating point number calculations, graphics processing, or data pattern matching|


## EC2 security group
- `security groups` are the fundamental of network security in AWS, they control how traffic is allowed in /out of EC2 Instances
- `security groups` act as `Firewall` to EC2 instances 

|Security Groups controls: |
|-|
|access to ports|
|authorized IP range|
|control of inbound network: IP or security group|
|control of outbound network: IP or security group|

- where:
> EC2 -> Network & Security -> Security Groups 

### Poperties:
- a security group can be applied to multiple instance: `one to many for reuse`
- a security groups need to be applies to any `region/VPC combination`
- EC2 instance does not know security group: `security group live 'outside' EC2`.
    - if a traffic is blocked EC2 instance will not know

- it's good to maintain a separate security group for SSH
- by default:
    - all inbound is `blocked`
    - all outbound is `authorized`


### Important Ports

|port|role|for|
|-|-|-|
|22|SSH(Secure Shell)|log into Linux instance|
|22|SFTP (security FTP)|file transfer|
|21|FTP (file transfer protocol)|file transfer|
|80|HTTP|unsecured access websites|
|443|HTTPS|secured access websites|
|3389|RDP(remote desktop protocol)|log into a remote windows instance|
||||


### debug security group

|||
|-|-|
|client get '`time out`'|it's very likely to be a security group issue|
|client get "connection refused"|it is not security group issue, the connection went through. (application issue or not launch)|

## Misc

### `Shared Responsibility Model` for EC2

|AWS|user|
|-|-|
|Infrastructure|Security Groups Rules, IAM Roles to EC2|
|Physical host isolation|OS update, maintainces|
|hardware maintainance|Software, Tools, data in the instances|
|compliance validation|data security to the instance|
### Attach IAM role to EC2 Instance
- [demo](https://www.udemy.com/course/aws-certified-cloud-practitioner-new/learn/lecture/20055746#overview)
> EC2 -> Instances -> select instance -> Actions -> Security -> Modify IAM role

# EC2 storage: 
## EBS Volumn
- An EBS (elastic block Store) volume is a `network drive` you can attach to your instancs while you run. Allow `persist data` after termination.
- Think of them as: `Network USB stick`
    - there are `network latency`
    - they can be `deteched` from one intance and `attached` to another intance quickly
    - locked to an Availability Zone(AZ), use `snapshot` to migrate between different zones
- In `Cloud Practioner level`, only `a EBS` can only be mounted to a EC2 instance, They must be the `same Availability Zone(AZ)`. An instance can has multiple EBS attached.
    - In sysOps will see some "multi-attach" feature of EBS
- New EBS volumn can be created (and billed by size and speed(IOPS))
### Hand-on: [demo](https://www.udemy.com/course/aws-certified-cloud-practitioner-new/learn/lecture/20055776#overview)

- After you attach an Amazon EBS volume to your instance, it is exposed as a block device. You must create a file system on them before you can mount and use them.
    - [Make an Amazon EBS volume available for use on Linux](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ebs-using-volumes.html)



### Delete on Termination attribute
- Delete on Termination: when an EC2 instance terminated, whether or not the EBS attached to it get deleted 
- by default:
    - `root` EBS volumn(one that is created when creating the instance): enabled
    - `attached EBS volumn`: disabled

### EBS Snapshot
- [demo](https://www.udemy.com/course/aws-certified-cloud-practitioner-new/learn/lecture/20055802#overview)
- back up (snapshot) of EBS
    - snapshots can be used to restore contents to another(or same) EBS volumn 
    - snapshots can be `copied` across Availability Zone`(AZ) or region`
- let's recommend it (but no necessary) to `detach` EBS vloumn from EC2 instance `before the snapshot`. Detaching make the snapshot clean.

- snapshot features
    - `create EBS volumn from snapshot`
    - `copy snapshot`
        -  make snapshot available to other region/AZ
    - `Snapshot archive`
        - move snapshot to `archive tier` make the storage 75% cheaper
        - it `takesn time to restore` snapshots from the archive (24 to 72 hours)
        - save cost for snapshot that is not in rush to restore
    - `snapshot Recycle Bin`
        - `Recycle Bi` is an standalone service in AWS
        - allow move Snapshots to bin after deletion, and specify `time Snapshots retain in the bin (1 day to 1 year)`
## EC2 Instance Store
Hardware disk that connect directly to the Instance host
- `better IO performance` than EBS
- `Ephemeral`: If instance terminated, all Instance Store lost
    - also subject to risk of hardware failed
- good for buffer, cathe,scratch data, temporaryl content. Backups are your responsibility

## EFS -  Elastic File System
- Network file system, true cloud storage
    - it is a shared storage space in the Internet, can be mount simultaneously to 100+ EC2 instance across different region/AZ.
    - High price, 3x gp2, pay per use, no need to plan size/capacity


|EBS|EFS|
|-|-|
|lock to an AZ/region, use snapshot to make duplicate in different AZ/region|Instances in different Region/AZ can access/read/write the same EFS storage|
|1 time the price|3 times the price|


### EFS-IA vs EFS standard
- EFS-IA(infrequent Access) tier optimize the cost to up to 92% less
- EFS will automatically move your `infrequent accessed files` from EFS standard to EFS-IA to save the cost
- Enable EFS-IA with a Lifecycle policy: (eg: move files that are not access for 60 days to EFS-IA)
## FSx
- launch and run popular (open source and commercially-licensed) file systems. Avoiding time-consuming administrative tasks like hardware provisioning, software configuration, patching, and backups
### Amazon FSx for Windows File Server
- Windows native shared file system
    - Support SMB protocol & NTFS
### Amazon FSx for Lustre(Linux+Cluster)
- a full managed,  high performance scalable file storage for `HPC (high performance computing)`
    - Machine Learning, Analytics, Video Prcessing, Financial Modeling
    - Scales up to 100s GB/s, millions of IOPS, sub-ms latencies

# EC2 Instance Purchasing Options(Discounts)
- On-Demand
- Reserved (1 & 3 years), Convertible Reserved 
- Saving Plan (1 & 3 years)
- Spot Instances
- Dedicated Hosts
- Dedicated Instances
- Capacity Reservations

|option|workload|price|
|-|-|-|
|On-Demand| short term and un-interrupted workloads|Highest|
|Reserved|steady-state app, database...|Discount by reserve time, upfront payment|
|Saving Plan|steady-state app, database...|discount based on usage and upfront |
|Spot Instances|failure resilitent jobs, not database or critical job|cheapest|
|Dedicated Hosts/instance|specific request|same as On-Demand|
|Capacity Reservations|need 100% availability for a time|same as On-Demand|

### Summary:
- On-Demand: come and staying in the resort whenever we like and pay the full price
- Reserved: plan a ahead how long to stay, if the saying duration is long enough, we might get a good discount
- Saving Plan: we know how much we want to spend(pay certain amount for a period) and want to spend it all. Can stay in any type of room, flex size.
- Spot Instances: hotel allows people the bid for any empty room at low price, if you fail the bid you will be kick out anytime
- Dedicated host: book an entire server
- Capacity Reservations: book room so I can have availability to the room at a period of time, I will be bill even though I don't check in

### On-Demand
- Pay for time you use
- Has the `highest cost` but no upfront payment
- recommended for short term and un-interrupted workloads

### Reserved (1 & 3 years)
- Reserved Instances:
    - User can reserve (1 & 3 years) specific instance attributes: Instance Type. Region, Tenancy, OS
- Convertible Reserved Instance: 
    - user can change instance attributes: Instance Type. Region, Tenancy, OS
- discount
    - the longer user reserve the larger the discount
    - the more upfront payment the larger discount
- you can buy and sell reserve instance in marketplace
- recommended for steady state usage applications (`database`...)

### Saving Plan (1 & 3 years)
- commitment to an amount of usage, then billed on-demand for usage beyond

- for long workload, discount based on long-term usage
- lock and switchable:
    - lock to a specific instance family and AWS region
    - flexible to : instance size, OS, tenancy

### Spot Instances
- very cheap, largest discount, less reliable, very short workload
- user define a `max price`. instances `can lose at any point of time`: if user's max price is less than the current spot price
- Most cost-efficient
- workloads:
    - suit: failure resistant: batch jobs, data analyst, image processing, distribute process
    - `not suit: critical jobs, databases`

### Dedicated Hosts:
- A physical serve dedicated to your use. Most expensive
- Options:
    - on demand
    - 1 or 3 years
- use case:
    - the company that have strong regulatory or compliance need
    - for software that have complicated licensing model(BYOL-Bring Your Own License)

### Dedicated Instances
![](https://imgur.com/l6VNnSi.jpg)
- dedicated instance, less access lower level hardware

### Capacity Reservations
- Reserve On-Demand instances capacity for a duration in an AZ:
    - guarantee user have access to EC2 capacity for the duration
    - Charge at on-demand rate whether user run the instances or not
- suitable for short term, uninterrupted workload that needs to be in a specific AZ



# AMI(amazon machine image)
- it is essentially an `snapshot of instance`: OS, OS config/environment, softwares
- faster boot/configuration time because of pre-packaged instance blueprint
- AMIs:
    - Amazon public AMI: official pre-made AMI
    - user customer AMI
    - AMI marketplace: upload/download, buy/sell

## AMI use case pipeline
- Start an EC2 Instance and customize it
- stop the instance
- Build AMI (this automatically create EBS snapshot)
- (Optional) Copy AMI to other region/AZ
- Launch an new instance from AMI

### Create Image
> EC2 -> Instances -> `<choose instance>` -> rightClick -> Image and templates -> create image

### Copy AMI
> EC2 -> Images -> AMIs -> `<choose AMI>` -> Action -> copy AMI


### Launch Instance from AMI
> EC2 -> Images -> AMIs -> `<choose AMI>` -> Launch Instance from AMI

### Deregister AMI
- after deregister an AMI user cannot use it to launch new instances
> EC2 -> Images -> AMIs -> `<choose AMI>` -> Action -> deregister AMI




## EC2 Image Builder
- Used to `automate` the creation, test and distribute of `EC2 AMI` or `Docker image`. An image building pipeline. 
    - can be run on a schedule (eg. whenever a package are updated)
    - free service, only pay for the underlying resource

# EC2 Scalability Tools
## ELB - Elastic Load Balancing
- `load balancers` is a `EC2 Server` that receive user request, and `forward these traffics` to multiple downstream EC2 servers based on `Load balancing algorithms`
- why 
    - `spread load` across multiple downstream instance
    - `Expose single access point` for the application
    - do regular health check to downstream instance and seamlessly `handle failures without interruption `
    - provide SSL (`HTTPs`) for your website

- `ELB`: AWS managed `load balancers`, 
    - maintained and setuped by AWS
    - expose user a few configurations
    - cost a litter more comparing to users' own load balancer, but save the effort
- ELB options:

|||
|-|-|
|Layer 7: Application Load Balancer(ALB)|`HTTP/ HTTPs/ gRPC; HTTP Routing; Static DNS` |
|Layer 4: Network Load Balance(NLB)|`ultra-high performance`(million req/s ultra low latency); `allows TCP/TLS/UDP; Static IP`|
|Layer 3: Gateway Load Balance|`GENEVE Protocol on IP Packets; Route traffic to Firewalls; Intrusion detection, deep Packets inspection(traffic analysis)`|

![](https://imgur.com/rOkzKAd.jpg)

### [ELB-ALB demo](https://www.udemy.com/course/aws-certified-cloud-practitioner-new/learn/lecture/20055874#overview)

- define `target group`: a group of instances that ELB-ALP are resopnsed to forward traffic to

## ASG - Auto Scaling Groups
- goal of ASG:
    - `Scale out(add instances) `to match an increased load
    - `Scale in(remove instances)` to match a decreased load
    - ensured the application have a `minimum and a maximum number` of machines running
    - ensure new instances are `registered to load balancer`
    - replace unhealthy instances
- ASG help saving cost: application always runs at an optimal capacity: elasticity

### [DEMO](https://www.udemy.com/course/aws-certified-cloud-practitioner-new/learn/lecture/20055896#overview)

### ASG Stratigies
- Manual Scaling: Update the scale manually
- Dynamic Scaling:
    - Simple/Step Scaling:  when a cloudWatch alarm is triggered
        - (eg: CPU > 70%) then add 2 units
        - (eg: CPU < 30%) then remove 1 unit
    - Target Tracking Scaling:
        - eg: I want average ASG CPU to stay around 40%
    - Scheduled Scaling:
        - anticipate scale based on known usage patterns
        - eg: increase min capacity to 10 at 5pm friday
- Machine Learning(Predictive) Scaling:
    - Use pattern recognition machine learning to predict future traffic load, and deploy the predict number of instances
    - useful when the load has predictable patterns


# AWS Batch
- a `batch job` is a job with a start and an end (opposite to `stream`/`continuous`)
- AWs `Batch` is `fully managed`, batch processing service 
    - In `Batch`, AWS invoke EC2 or Spot instance that run docker image that specify the work, under the hood
    - `Batch` `provision&allocate the right amount of compute/memory source` based on the workload you submit. Optimize the cost for you

### Batch vs lambda

|Batch|lambda|
|-|-|
|no time limit|15 mins time limit|
|Rely on EBS/instance store|Limited temporary disk|
|AWS managed EC2/spot instances|Serverless|
|||


# Lightsail:
- Server + storage + database + networking
- use case: simple web applications, `easy deployment`
    - blueprint for: WordPress, Plesk, MEAN, Nginx...
- `No auto-scaling`, very limited AWS services integraitons


# AWS SSM: Systems Manager
- manage `EC2 and On-Premises` system (`Hybrid` AWS service)
    - 10+ AWS produces
    - `run scripts/patches to a fleet of servers`
    - get `insight` about your infrasturcture
- SSM agent (client software)

## SSM session Manager
- Allow to `start a secure shell` on `EC2 and On-Premises servers`
    - without `SSH` and port 22  for better security    
    - `SSH` and `EC2 instance connect` both requires `port 22` open

[demo](https://www.udemy.com/course/aws-certified-cloud-practitioner-new/learn/lecture/29102378#overview)


## OpsWorks
- `Chef` and `Puppet` are 3rd party tools to perform 
    - auto server configuration 
    - repetitive actions
- in essense `they are Alternative to AWS SSM`


- they work on `EC2 and On-Premises` VMs
- `OpsWorks` allows `manage the two tools in AWS framework`

# AWS Outposts
- use AWS hardware and AWS service on-primise (Hybrid cloud)
- AWS guys comes and setup/ manage the `outpost racks` (essential large server hardware) `within your on-premises place`
- `outpost racks`: provide same infrastructure, service, APIs, tools, just like in the cloud

- benefit:
    - Data residency
    - easy migration from outpost to the aws
