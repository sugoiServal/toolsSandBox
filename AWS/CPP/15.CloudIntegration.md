## CloudIntegration: 
- applications communication in the cloud
    - synchronous communication
    - asynchronous(event based) communication: `decoupled`
        - SQS: Queue 
        - SNS: pub/sub model
        - Kinesis: Real time data streaming model

# SQS - simple queue service

- first tier application produce some messages, The message is sent into the queue. Then the lower tier application poll message from the queue with certain algorithms to process the request

- features
    - Serverless
    - used to decouple application
    - scaled to 10000s messsaged/sec
    - `retention` of messages: 4-14 days


# Kinesis
- Kinesis =  real-time big data streaming
- `collect, process and analyze real time streaming data at any scale`
- managed service

# SNS
- pub/sub model: send `messages` in a `topic` to many receivers(`subscriber` to the topic)
- upto 12500000 subscribers/topic, 100000 topics limit
- `no message retention`

# Amazon MQ:
- traditional open protocols(not AWS native): MQTT, AMQP, STOMP, Openwire, WSS
    - MQ helps integrate these traditional solution in the cloud
        - Managed message broker service for: `RabbitMQ`, `ActiveMQ`
    - `SQS. SNS alternative`

- feature:
    - `non-serverless`
    - does `not scale` as SQS/SNS
