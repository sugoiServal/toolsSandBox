# share responsibility Model
- AWS responsibility - Security of the Cloud
    -   Protecting infrastructure (hardware, software, facilities, and networking) that  runs all the AWS services
    -   Managed services like S3, DynamoDB, RDS, etc.

- Customer responsibility - Security in the Cloud
    -  For EC2 instance, customer is responsible for management of the guest OS
(including security patches and updates), firewall & network configuration, IAM
    -  Encrypting application data 


# WAF & Shield: DDos protection
# Shield
- CloudFront and Route 53 is combined with AWS shield
### Shield Standard
-  for all customers at `no additional costs`
- protect against:
    - SYN/UDP floods, reflection attacks, layer3/ layer4 attacks
### Shield Advanced
- `24/7 premium DDoS protection`, at `cost` $3000/month
- protect `to more sophisticated`

## WAF - web application firewall
- `Filter requests` based on rules, protect against `layer 7 (HTTP)` web exploit
    - layer 7 (HTTP)
    - related to `NACL`
- rule include:
    - IP
    - HTTP header, body,
    - url string
    - against SQL injection, corss-site scripting(XSS)
    - geo-loaction
    - size contraints
    - frequency/rate (DDoS)

# Penetration Testing on AWS
- `Penetration Testing`:  test security of your own system by trying to attack the AWS infrastructure
- AWS `allows some` services to be penetration tested without approval while `prohibits others`

|Allowed|Prohibited|
|-|-|
|EC2, NAT gateway, Elastic Load Balancer|DNS zone walking via Route 53|
|RDS|DDoS|
|CloudFront|port flooding|
|Aurora|protocol flooding|
|API Gateways|request flooding|
|Lambda||
|Lightsail||
|Elastic Beanstalk||

- for other tests, need to consult AWS


# Encryption
- Encryption `at rest` vs Encryption `at transit`
    - at rest: encrypt data `in a storage`
    - at transit: encrypt data being `moved` from one place to the other `over Internet`
- two Encryption services: `KMS, CloudHSM`
## KMS - key management service
- most used service for encryption on AWS
- `encryption key`: encrypted data can only be decrypted with an `encryption key`
- KMS = `AWS manages the encryption keys` for us, `user dont access the key`

- opt-in or default enable
    - some services have KMS `automatically enabled`:
        - CloudTrail logs
        - S3 Glacier
    - most of services can opt-in KMS decryption (S3, EBS...)

## CloudHSM - Hardware Security Module
- AWS manage `HSM (Hardware Security Module)`, which is used to encrypt data
- `you manage the key` manually with `CloudHSM client`
- user access keys through SSL connection to AWS

## Types of Customer Master Keys: CMK
- `Customer Managed` CMK:
    - Create, manage and used` by the customer`
    - advanced features: key-rotation, External key source, CloudHSM...
    - cost money per key
- `AWS managed `CMK
    - Created, managed and used on the customer’s behalf `by AWS`, but `owned by customer`
    - `user dont access the keys`
    - Used by AWS services (s3, ebs, redshift...)

- CloudHSM Keys (`custom keystore`): 
    - Keys generated `from your own CloudHSM hardware` device
    - Cryptographic operations are performed in AWS CloudHSM cluster

- `AWS owned` CMK:
    - AWS use these keys to protect users (multiple account), but no user can view/use these keye 

# AWS Certificate Manager (ACM)
- manage, and deploy `SSL/TLS Certificates` for `HTTPS`
    - supports both `public and private TLS certificates`
    - `Free` for `public TLS` certificates
    - `Automatic TLS certificate renewal`

- provide HTTPS encryption for websites 
    - integration to:
        - Elastic Load Balancers
        - CloudFront
        - APIs on API Gateway

# AWS Secrets Manager
- store secrets
- support `rotation of secrets` (+ Lambda)
- Integration to AWS `RDS`(MySQL, PostgreSQL, Aurora)
- Secrets are `encrypted using KMS`

# GuardDuty
- `Machine Learning` threat detection
- input data includes:
    - `CloudTrail` Events Logs – unusual API calls, unauthorized deployments
    - CloudTrail Management Events – create VPC subnet, create trail, …
    - CloudTrail S3 Data Events – get object, list objects, delete object, …
    - `VPC Flow` Logs – unusual internal traffic, unusual IP address
    - `DNS Log`s – compromised EC2 instances sending encoded data within DNS queries
    - `Kubernetes Audit Logs` – suspicious activities and potential EKS cluster compromises
- protection against `CryptoCurrency` attack
- integration:
    - `EventBridge` rules to trigger `Lambda or SNS`

# Inspector
- think 杀毒软件, `DB based` `threat/vulnerabilities` detection
- `Security Assessments(scan)` to three services
    - `EC2 instances`
        - Leveraging the AWS System Manager (SSM) agent
        -  unintended `network accessibility`
        - `known OS vulnerabilities`
    - `ECR Container` images
        - analysis when Images are pushed
    - `Lambda functions`
        - analysis when functions are deployed
        - vulnerabilities in function `code` and `dependencies`
- finding:
    - risks, threat, 
    - return a risk score associated with all vulnerabilities
- integration:
    - `EventBridge`
    - `Security Hub`
- how: compare against a `vulnerabilities database`(CVE)

    - malware
- how:  `AWS abuse form`, or `abuse@amazonaws.com`


# root user privileges
root user =  account owner > most privileged user
- Do not use the root account for everyday tasks, even administrative tasks

- `root user` only privileged actions:
    - `Change account settings` (account name, email address, root user password, root user access keys)
    - View certain tax invoices
    - `Close your AWS account`
    - `Restore IAM` user permissions
    - Change or cancel your `AWS Support plan`

    - Edit or delete an Amazon S3 bucket policy that includes an invalid VPC ID or VPC endpoint ID
    - Sign up for `GovCloud`

# IAM Access Analyzer
- scan resources access exposure. Find out which `resources are shared/exposed` ouside a `zone of trusts` -- a user defined group
    - exposed resources are flagged as `findings`
    - `provide actions to fix` the exposure
