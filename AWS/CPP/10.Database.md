# Database overview
- Database vs data storage:
    - `structured` data
    - fast `query`
    - can define `relationships` between dataset
|SQL(RDB)|NonSql|
|-|-|
|shchemas|flexible schemas|
|hard to scale horizonally|easy scale horizonally|

- Non-SQL includes
    - Key-Value(document)
    - Graph
    - in-memory
    - search databases

### AWS Managed Database vs EC2 self-managed Databases
|AWS Managed Database|EC2 self-managed Databases|
|-|-|
|Quick provision, high availability|handle by yourself|
|easy Vertiacal/Horizontal scaling|handle by yourself|
|auto Backup/restore|handle by yourself|
|OS, software maintained by AWS|handle by yourself|
|monitoring, alerting dashboard|handle by yourself|
|read performance optimization|handle by yourself|
|Multi AZ setup, Disaster Recovery|handle by yourself|
|cannot SSH|can SHH into the database instance|

### A Classic database Architecture

# RDS
- `RDS` is AWS Managed relational database service
- using SQL query language
- AWS mananged SQL services includes
    - Postgres
    - mySQL
    - MariaDB
    - Oracle
    - Aurora(AWS's database)
    - MS SQL Server

- use case
    - online Transaction Processing (`OLTP`)
        - (order processing, banking, inventory management, airline reservations)

[demo](https://www.udemy.com/course/aws-certified-cloud-practitioner-new/learn/lecture/20055980#overview)

### DB snapshot: backup and restore DB
- create snapshot
> RDS -> databases -> database -> Actions ->  Take sanpshot
- Restore snapshot: create new DB from snapshot
- Copy snapshot (to different region)
- Share snapshot (with other accounts)
- Migrate snapshot


## RDS deployment options
### RDS read replica:
- `read replica` allows `scale database read operation horizontally`
- How? 
    - create replica of the database, application `balance read request` to multiple `read replicas`
    - `writing operation only done to the main RDS instance`, and then propogate to the replicas

### Multi-AZ(failover)
- main purpose is high availability
- create an `failover RDB in other AZ`
- normally application write and read data to the `main RDS`
- when `main RDS` outrage/fail, then switch to the `failover`
- `can only have 1 RDB in other AZ as failover`

### Multi-region
- similar to read replica, but propagate replicas in different regions
- Why:
    - better local(globally) read performance
    - Disaster recovery in case of region issue
- cons: replication cost

## Aurora
- relational database
- Amazon technology, not open source
- support postgreSQL and MySQL

> is `AWS cloud optimized`: 5x performance over MySQL on RDS, 3x performance over postgreSQL on RDS

- Aurora cost more than RDS, and not in free-tier(RDS in free-tier)


# ElastiCache
- an AWS managed `Redis` or `Memcached` databse
    - both `in-memory database` with high performance/low latency
    - helps reduce read intensive workload from database 

- architect

# DynamoDB
- AWS managed NoSQL
- flagship product of AWS:
    - `scales` massive workload
    - `distrubuted`, `serveless` DB ()
    - low latency retrieval, `x ms level latency`
    - `millions of request/second`
    - huge storage: `100s of TB`
    - `auto scaling` capability
    - `IAM` integration

- serverless:
    - By serverless you `don't need to create any database` inside any instance, just `create a table and you can use it`
- save cost with `class`
    - `Standard` or `Infrequent Access(IA)` classes

- [demo](https://www.udemy.com/course/aws-certified-cloud-practitioner-new/learn/lecture/20055998#overview)

## DynamoDB Global Tables
- make a DynamoDB table accessible with `low latency` in `multiple regions`
- through `two-way replication`. user in both region can` read and write to the (essentially) same table`
- `Active-Active replication`

## DynamoDB Accelerator - DAX
- `in-memory cache` for only `DynamoDB`
> 10x performance improvement, Âµs level latency


# DocumentDB
- similar to Aurora, DocumentDB is `AWS implementation of MongoDB`

- full managed, highly availability, replication across `3 AZ`
- automatically growing storage in 10GB interval, up to 64TB

- millions of request/second

# Neptune
- Fully managed `Graph database`
- `Graph database`:
    - a good example of `graph dataset` is `social network`
    - `knowledge graphs` (eg, Wikipedia)
    - fraud detection application
    - recommendation engines

- highly availability `3 AZ`, up to `15 read replicas`
- optimized for complex and hard queries
- can store up to `billions of relations`

# Amazon QLDB - Quantum Ledger Database
- a `cryptographical` (blockchain) `immutable` database system (a ledger)
    - used to review history of all the changes made to your application data, which cannot be changed afterward
    - used to store financial transaction
- Fully managed, replica across 3 AZ
- 2-3x better performance then common  blockchain frameworks
- manipulate data with SQL

- The system is `centralized and managed by Amazon`, which inline with many financial regulation rules
    - whereas `Amazon Managed Blockchain is decentralized`

# Amazon Managed Blockchain
- Blockchain: 
    - Blockchain make it possible to build applications where multiple parties can execute `transactions without the need for trusted, central authority`
- `Amazon Managed Blockchain` has `decentralized` components
- a `managed service` to:
    - Join public blockchain networks
    - or create your own scalable private blockchain network (in AWS)
- Compatible to `major Blockchain framework`: 
    - Hyperledger Fabric
    - Ethereum

# DMS: database migration service
- `Migration data` from `Source DB` to `Target DB` 
- need to running in `EC2 instance`, not serverless
- the `source database remains available during the migration`

- Supports:
    - `Homogeneous` migrations: `Source DB` to `Target DB` use same DB technology (eg Oracle)
    - `Heterogeneous` migrations: `Source DB` to `Target DB` use different DB technology (eg MS SQL to Aurora)
