# Docker

## ECR - elastic container registry
Amazon private `Docker repository` (similar to Docker Hub) 
- the place where you store your docker images

## ECS - elastic container service
- launch Docker containers on AWS
    - `user provision & maintain a number of EC2 instance`
    - ECS takes care of starting and stopping the container in these EC2 instance (smart deployment)
    - ECS has integration with` application load balancer(ALB)`

## Fargate
- `serverless container service`
    - no need to provision & maintain EC2 instance
    - user specify the docker image and the resource needed, then Fargate run it

# Infrastructure as code (IaC)
## CloudFormation
- An `declarative` IaC tool to config AWS infrastructure
- use JSON or YAML (called `template`)

- Benefit of IaC:
    - no manually create resources,better control
    - review infrastructure as code, better readability
    - review cost at infrastructure provision time

- CloudFormation
    - support `all AWS resources`
    - can use existing `template`
    - auto generated `Diagram`

- free to use

[demo1](https://www.udemy.com/course/aws-certified-cloud-practitioner-new/learn/lecture/20216528#overview)


## CDK - Cloud Development Kit
- IaC tool that use `programming language` instead of JSON/YAML. `Compile` into `CloudFormation` form
    - JS/TS, Python, Java, .NET..
    - these code will be `compiled into JSON/YAML`
    - Then `CloudFormation` is invoked to use the `JSON/YAML`

- example code

# PaaS - platform as a service
## Beanstalk

- `PaaS`
- free to use
> You simply upload your code and Elastic Beanstalk automatically handles the deployment, from capacity provisioning, load balancing, and automatic scaling to web application health monitoring, with ongoing fully managed patch and security updates

- `Beanstalk use CloudFormation` behind the scene
- Support `all major languages and Docker`
- PaaS:
    - `AWS managed infrastructure` for `Web application`/computation: EC2, ASG, ELB, RDS ...
        - Instances, OS
        - depolyment strategy
        - Capacity provision, scaling
        - load balancing
        - health monitering
    - expose to user Developer view: upload the code

- `Health Monitering`: 
    - Beanstalk has build-in health Monitering which push metrics directly into `CloudWatch`


# CICD

## CodeStar
- `Unified UI` to setup `all AWS CICD features` in one place
- A central service to AWS CICD daily usage
[demo](https://www.udemy.com/course/aws-certified-cloud-practitioner-new/learn/lecture/24682584#overview)

## CodePipeline
[demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWQ48da0UOc)
- Orchestrate the whole code deployment pipeline 
    - Code -> -> test -> build -> deploy

- Support both AWS devops services and 3rd-party services (eg, github)

## CodeCommit
- `A code repository`, as alternative to `Github`, `Gitlab`
- `Git based`
- Fully managed, and private (inside your AWS account)


## CodeArtifact
- Application `dependency management`: helps developers to `storing and retrieving dependencies`
- works with common dependency tools:
    - maven, Gradle,
    - npm, yarn
    - pip
    - twine, NuGet


## CodeBuild
- Code builder in the cloud, ready to deploy(eg, CodeDeploy)
    - compiles source codes, 
    - run tests, 
    - produce packages(maven etc...)

- serverless, fully managed, secure
- pay for the build time

## CodeDeploy

> `Automate` code deployments to maintain application uptime

- Servers/instances must be provisioned before using CodeDeploy
- Works both `EC2 instance` and `On-Premises servers(Hybrid)`



## Amazon CodeGuru
- ML-powered. `ML algorithm`
    - Hard-learned lessons across millions of code reviews on 1000s of open-source and Amazon repositories


- pre-production/ post-production

- `automated code reviews`/ `application performance recommendation` 
    - `CodeGuru reviewer`:  `detect bug/memory leak, etc` in code, when submit to a repo  
    - `CodeGuru profiler`:  `detect perfromance expensive line of codes`, and give recommendation

- reviwer:
    - Supports Java and Python
    - integrates with GitHub, Bitbucket, and AWS CodeCommit

- profiler:
    - Example: identify if your application is consuming excessive CPU capacity on a logging routine
    - • Identify and remove code inefficiencies
    - • Improve application performance (e.g., reduce CPU utilization)
    - • Decrease compute costs
    - • Provides heap summary (identify which objects using up memory)
    - • Anomaly Detection
