# Lambda - Serverless computation
### serverless
- `Serverless` is a paradigm in which the developer `don't have to manage service` anymore, focusing only on their application
    - Severless == FaaS(function as a service)
    - not limit to function in AWS:
        - functions(`Lambda`)
        - Databases(`DynamoDB`)
        - Storage(`S3`)
        - Application Deployment(`Fargate`)
        - etc
## Lambda properties
- Service usage limited by function `executions time`

- `Auto resource scaling` based on the request load!!
    - up to 10GB RAM/ function
- Pricing:
    - pay by `#requests` and `compute time`
- free-tier: 1 million Lambda requests, 400000 GB-seconds(RAM) of compute time / month

- Reactive:
    - allow event-driven functions execution
    - eg: by AWS enents
- Monitoring: integration AWS CloudWatch

## Use case example
### [handon Demo](https://www.udemy.com/course/aws-certified-cloud-practitioner-new/learn/lecture/20056026#overview)

### create a Image thumbnail

- Event driven Lambda:
    - (whatever the user upload an image into S3)
    - (Lambda) create an thumbnail of the image and push it into S3
    - (Lambda) also pushed image metadata into dynamoDB
### CRON Job
- `A CRON job` is a scheduled task that is automatically executed by a computer's operating system at a `predetermined time and interval`.

## Misc
### Lambda Container Image
- allow `Lambda to run container image`
    - the container image must implement the `Lambda Runtime API`
    - preferred way is using `Fragate`.

# Amazon API Gateway
- Building a serverless API in Lambda
- `API Gateway` allows `expose Lambda function as an API to client`
- architecture:

- API Gateway:
    - `serverless`
    - support: Rest APIs, WebSocket APIs
    - support: security, user authentication, API keys, API throttling, monitoring
