    - RDS `read replica`: scale horizontally read-only instances, writing only done to main RDS => improves `read performance`, database `scalability`, `disaster recovery`
    - Multi-AZ(`failover`) == `availability`: `failover RDB in other AZ`, switch to `failover` when `main RDS` outrage/fail
    - `Multi-region`: read replica in multiple regions: better `globally read performance` + `failover(disaster recovery)`
