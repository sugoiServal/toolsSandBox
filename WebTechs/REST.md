// Part 1. REST API:
    // representational state transfer API
        // REST: is a software architectural style (design art) that was created to guide the design of network applications
        // properties:
            // relies on a stateless, client-server protocol -- HTTP at most time
            // treats server objects as resources: can be created and destroyed at will
            // multi-language support (just need to have JSON and HTTP support)
            // APIs have their own rules and structures
            
        // API = Application Programming Interface  
                // Contract provided by one piece of software to another
                // structured requests and responses
                // generally through a URL (format defined by the application)
