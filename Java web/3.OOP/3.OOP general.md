|member-level|public, none(default, package-private), private, protected|


### Class Access Modifier:
- public
  - class must be same name as the file name
  > A public class is accessable to all classes anywhere in the application. Access the class with an `import`
```java
// in Base.java
public class Base {
  // code omitted
}
// in any file within the project
import com.apress.bgn.zero.Base;
```
- package-private(default/none)
  - the class can be used to create objects only by the classes defined in the same package(folder). 


### Member Access Modifier:
- public
  - member is accessable from anywhere
- protected:
  - first case: from within its own package
  - second case: by any subclass of its class(anywhere)
- package-private(default/none)
  - from within its own package
- private: 
  - accessed from the class where member is declared.
