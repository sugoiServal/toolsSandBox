## Stack and Heap

### `stack` memory - reference and primitive variables
- a stack is created for each method call/JVM execution thread
- Size can be specified using `JVM parameter -Xss`
- `java.lang.StackOverflowError` (eg: recursion without termination)

### `heap` memory - objects
- allocated memory for developor created objects (`new` keyword)
- Objects created inside the heap memory can be accessed by all threads of the application.
- depends in the available physical memory, `java.lang.OutOfMemoryError`

## Variable lifecycle
- 局部变量存活于调用函数的存活期间
- reference object在最后一个reference消失后, 变成GCable, JVM的GC会在内存不足时释放
    - 通过deref来确保不需要的资源被释放
        - 产生reference variable的调用函数的存活期间结束 
        - 唯一的reference variable被赋值到其他object
        - 将reference variable赋值null


## Method Parameter Passing mechanism
- `everything in Java is pass-by-value`
- `primitive` is passed by copying value into a Method, changes to the parameter have `no effect on the original variable`
```java
static void swap(int a, int b) {
    int temp = a;a = b;b = temp;
}
int k = 42;int q = 44;
swap(k, q); // k and q unchanged outside swap
```
- `primitive` is passed by copying the reference. ("references" act/feel more like what we'd call "pointers" (address))

```java
public class Dog {
    private String name;
    public Dog(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }
    public String getName() {
        return this.name;
    }
    public static void foo(Dog someDog) {
        someDog.setName("Max");   // copied reference to object in address 1 modified 
    }
    public static void bar(Dog someDog) {
        someDog = new Dog("Fifi");  // copied reference changed its reference    
    }
    public static void main(String args[]) {
        Dog myDog = new Dog("Rover");   // address 1
        Dog.foo(myDog);    
        System.out.println(myDog.getName()); // Max
    }
    public static void main(String args[]) {
        Dog myDog = new Dog("Rover");   // address 1
        Dog.bar(myDog);
        System.out.println(myDog.getName());  // Rover, original reference still point to address 1
    }
}
```

## Garbage Collection 
- Java provide automatic Garbage Collector
    - when object have no reference(unreachable), GC finds and tracks these `unused objects` by `scaning the heap`. the scan algorithm is called `mark-and-sweep`  

- `memory leak` is still a potential, when 
  - unawarely, user code `continues to reference the object` even it's `no longer being used`.

### Prevent memory leak in Java
- `Create objects inside a method`: After methods ends, objects created within it become GCable
- manually `Nullify/reassign reference variable` (eg, try/catch/`finally`)
- Create an `anonymous object`. An anonymous object doesn’t have a reference, so the garbage collector will mark and remove it during the next garbage collection cycle.


### GC not so important details
- partition of Heap memory: Eden, Survivor, Tenured
    - `Eden` for newly created object, it is frequently GC scaned
    - `zero and one Survivor`, longer living object are moved Survivor, which are less checked compare to Eden
    - `Tenured` for object surving a certain number of GC cycles, it is least checked

- Java GC behavior can be modified:
    - Serial garbage collector
    - Parallel garbage collector(default in JVM)
    - Concurrent mark-and-sweep collector (CMS)
    - Garbage first (G1) 

- GC triggering events:
    - `Minor events`: when new generation (Eden + Survivor0 + Survivor1 spaces) are full
    - `Major events`: These clear space in both the young and old generations, which takes longer time
    - `System.gc()`: Explicitly calling System.gc(), cause an expensive stop-the-world phase -- significant performance penalty. Known for a bad practice.
