# Naming Conventions: TODO [link](https://www.theserverside.com/feature/Java-naming-conventions-explained#:~:text=For%20variables%2C%20the%20Java%20naming,a%20lower%20camel%20case%20syntax.)
# Java ecosystem
The Java ecosystem is a collection of tools, frameworks, and libraries:

|||
|-|-|
|The Java Development Kit (JDK)|a set of tools and libraries that are used to develop Java applications. It includes the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) and the Java compiler(javac).|
|The Java Runtime Environment (JRE)||
|JVM|an abstract computing machine that enables a computer to run **Java bytecode**. platform-independent and support multiple languages: **Groovy, Scala, Kotlin**|
|Java SE (Standard Edition) and Java EE (Enterprise Edition)|Java SE is used for developing standalone applications. Java EE is built-upon Java SE and used for developing enterprise-level applications. Java is currently managed by **Oracle**|
|Java frameworks|Spring, Struts, and Hibernate. frameworks that provide a set of reusable components and abstractions for building specific Java applications. Especially in web.|
|Tools|logging, testing, database access, etc|
|Build tools such as Maven and Gradle|tools used to automate the process of building, testing, and deploying Java applications.|
|Java IDEs like Eclipse, **IntelliJ IDEA**|Integrated Development Environments|



## JVM
- java is **high-level programming language**, ie independent of a particular type of computer, but must be translated by a compiler or interpreted into machine language
- **JVM** stands for Java Virtual Machine, which is an abstract, platform-independent computing machine that enables a computer to run a Java program.

- JVM responsible for
  - Loads code
  - Verifies code
  - Executes code
  - Provides runtime environment

- differences to compiler languages(eg, c++)
The Java Virtual Machine (JVM) is a virtual machine that `runs Java bytecode`, which is `a program that has been compiled from Java source code`. The JVM is designed to be platform-independent, meaning that Java code can run on any system that has a JVM installed. This is in contrast to traditional compiler languages, such as C and C++, which are compiled to machine code that is specific to the architecture of the system on which it will run. Additionally, JVM provides built-in memory management and automatic `garbage collection`, which is different from other traditional compiler languages where it is developer's responsibility to manage memory.

|JVM|compiler|
|--|--|
|JVM run Java bytecode(compile from java source code|compiler compile source code to machine code|
|mimic Java processor, platform-independent|machine code specific to a platform|
|built-in memory management and automatic garbage collection|manage memory is responsibility to developer|
|slower |faster|

# Project Structure (botton top)
## `terms, overview`
|||
|-|-|
|.java|all types (classes, object types) are described in `.java` file|
|.class |`.java`, after compiled, becomes `.class` file which follow the same package structure(file structure)|
|Main||
|package|packages are basically folders, contains either `nested packages` or `.java` file, they follow the same directory structure as the os|
|jar |`.class` will be package into `jars` after the compilation and linkage|
|artifacts|`jars` which hosted in repository, such as The `Maven` Public Repository, are called as artifacts|
|modules|A module may contains many packages, it is basically single purpose library: |
|library|library is a logical collection of jars/modules each containing implementation to a certain functionality, together form a library. A library can contains many modules. |
|Java application|A moderately complex Java application references one or more libraries: JDK, external dependencies libs, core functionalities|

- [Java: The difference between a module, a library, and a package](https://levelup.gitconnected.com/java-what-is-the-difference-between-a-module-a-library-and-a-package-468aeae4e79)
>  For example, you might have a `collections` library which contains a `List` module, a `Set` module and a `Map` module inside a single `library`. Each pack as a jar file
## `.java file`

- .java file can contains class and various object types such as

|||
|-|-|
|class|member, methods, accessor(class/member)|
|interfaces||
|enums||
|annotations||
|records||



## `package` 
- packages are essentially `folder`, contains either packages or .java file.
- packages name convention:
  - be unique
  - typically begin the name with your organizationâ€™s Internet domain name in reverse order, then add various grouping criteria.
- `package declaration at top of a java file`
```java
package com.apress.ch.one.hw;
```
- `package import`
```java
import java.util.List;
```
- package represents a hierarchy of directories
  - Each directory contains other directories(package) and/or Java files.

## `Module`
- Basically a collection of related Java packages and associated resources with a descriptor file.
- described by a file named `module-info.java`, located at the root of the source(src) directory. It contains many module meta info:
  - To be added

- misc:
  - `module-info.java` will be compile into `.class` as any other .java files
  - unlike `package`, `module` is not a java syntax keyword: is an abstract concept fulfilled by the config file `module-info.java`

# misc
### `package-info.java` file
- an info file contains: package declaration, package annotations, package comments, and Javadoc annotations.
- can be used to:
  - exported to the development documentation (**Javadoc**)
  - generate `Javadoc` with `Maven`
- `package-info.java` must reside under the root of a package(aka directory)
